This is achieved by having a desktop client that automatically synchronises specified file systems to the cloud (in order to provide back-ups), while also allowing files to be accessed from any machine of the user's choice. As well as this, xDrive comes equipped with two clients, one for the desktop (to synchronise/view files) and another on the web – where a user may view, add, and remove synchronised or added files of their choosing. Finally, in addition to previously mentioned features, users may also upload/download other files of choice from/to the cloud platform effortlessly, with the assurance that their data is stored securely and safely on the DCU's xDrive system.\\n\",\n",

A user records themselves performing an exercise, and the footage is analysed with the use of OpenPose. Once the key points on the body have been located,\\na set of mathematical heuristics such as the slope, angle and distance between points are evaluated to determine whether or not the exercise has been performed correctly. Pocket Trainer can evaluate four exercises: Bicep curl, pull up, squat and deadlift. The aim of the application is prevent injuries occurring from movements being performed incorrectly, and to improve overall exercise efficiency.\\n\",\n",

The main objective of the project is to build a toolkit for GAA clubs nationwide to use to become more environmentally sustainable. The method used to design the toolkit is a function modelling method entitled IDEF0. This method graphically represents the toolkit user experience with the end user in mind, while making considerations for a given club's limitations and resources. The models robust design ensures that the toolkit is applicable to GAA clubs regardless of the club's background.\\n\",\n",

Hydrogen gas has always been an interesting molecule in fuel cell applications. However, some of its problems include its reactive nature, storage and the cost of storage in comparison to other fuels. This project involved the development of a rig to house the reaction of aluminum and water with the help of a carbon catalyst to produce a hydrogen gas sample. The gas was then analysed for the detection and volume of gases present in the sample.\\n',\n",

Conventional methods currently in practice to stimulate nerves, such as the use of ice and blunt needles, are considered outdated as they do not test for a response at the surgical site, and are difficult to quantify. As anaesthetic causes vasodilation, subsequently heating the skin, the aim of the project is to use thermography to monitor the spread of the block.

The Xbox 360 Kinect was used as the sensor. A program was developed which presents a graphically generated birds eye view of the scene with the pallet's location clearly marked. This allows the operator to easily judge the alignment of the forklift with the pallet and make necessary adjustments if needed. The system was developed to be ultimately integrated into a fully autonomous vehicle.\\n\",\n",

Odin is equally concerned with both the execution and the expected behavior of your job, which is described entirely by the user's code. Observability into live values in code is achieved through the use of Odin's language specific libraries.

My project presents a new type of bonding technique, bonding using Galinstan-directed ohmic heating, which could be a potential solution to this problem. From analyses conducted, it was concluded that using the proposed bonding technique requires only 2.713s to melt the PMMA at the interface. When allowed to cool, it produced strong bonds with similar strengths to that of much more expensive bonding methods used.'},\n",

The structures to be tested include the two main auxetic structure types, namely re-entrant and chiral, as well as s-hynge and stacked-arrow structures. The structures are designed using SolidWorks 3D modelling software and tensile simulation tests are first performed on them using the finite element analysis (FEA) simulation feature in SolidWorks Tensile tests are then performed on the samples using the Zwick Z005 machine. Samples are first analysed as single core structures before progressing to multicore and cylindrical arrangements. The intention is to determine which design provides the most lateral extension for a specific applied longitudinal extension.'},\n",
