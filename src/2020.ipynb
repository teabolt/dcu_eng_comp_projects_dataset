Once the key points on the body have been located,\\na set of mathematical heuristics such as the slope, angle and distance between points are evaluated to determine whether or not the exercise has been performed correctly.

Odin is designed to eliminate the DevOps definition of toil; work tied to running a service which is manual, repetitive and automatable. DevOps is practiced in the tools a team uses, and when traditional job schedulers fail they introduce a new level of toil in debugging.\\nOdin is equally concerned with both the execution and the expected behavior of your job, which is described entirely by the user’s code. Observability into live values in code is achieved through the use of Odin’s language specific libraries. For teams, this means Odin can directly help diagnose where the problems are and get to the root cause of any interruptions.\\nProject Video                    shorturl.at/AINZ8\\nProject Area                      Automation, Control Systems, Data Analytics, Distributed Systems, Software Development, Web Application\\nProject Technology            Go, JavaScript, MongoDB, Nodejs, Python, REST, Raft Consensus Protocol',\n",

This is achieved by having a desktop client that automatically synchronises specified file systems to the cloud (in order to provide back-ups), while also allowing files to be accessed from any machine of the user’s choice. As well as this, xDrive comes equipped with two clients, one for the desktop (to synchronise/view files) and another on the web – where a user may view, add, and remove synchronised or added files of their choosing. Finally, in addition to previously mentioned features, users may also upload/download other files of choice from/to the cloud platform effortlessly, with the assurance that their data is stored securely and safely on the DCU’s xDrive system.\\n',\n",

With increasing demand for student accommodation, there is a lack of student specific platforms for students to source accommodation. StudentStay tackles this issue, bridging the gap between landlords and students, bringing them together. The platform enables landlords to advertise their properties and allow students to view and enquire about properties that interest them. Students can also find other like\\n-minded students to house share with. StudentStay makes renting easier and safer for both landlords and students.\\n',\n",

My project presents\\na new type of bonding technique, bonding using Galinstan-directed ohmic heating, which could be a potential solution to this problem. From analyses conducted, it was concluded that using the proposed bonding technique requires only 2.713s to melt the PMMA at the interface.
