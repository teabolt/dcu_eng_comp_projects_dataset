At each stage of the analysis an intermediate representation of the source program is generated, this is passed through the compiler phases, with the fi nal stage using this representation to generate the target code.

The execution of the target code in the WINMIPS64 environment will allow students to associate the C code to the corresponding MIPS64 code.
