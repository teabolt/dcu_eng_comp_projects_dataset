The app records data from the GPS and accelerometer sensors\\nduring a users car journey and identifies locations of potential potholes on a map, which can be\\naccessed by local councils who can then schedule repairs.\\nDetecting potholes on roads and deciding when they need to be repaired is a labour-intensive task.\\nCurrently the public report potholes through forms on county councils websites, by email or by phone.\\nThese all require manual user input and are prone to human error. Bump takes a participative\\nsensing approach to this.\\nAn app, running on an iPhone or Android smartphone, is started when the user starts a car journey.\\nThe app records the GPS location and the accelerometer motion. When the journey is completed the\\nuser signals this and the app processes the movement data to detect what are most likely to be\\npotholes. The user can also be prompted to confirm potholes to further improve accuracy. The\\nintensity and location of the potholes identified are then placed on a map. The map interface will\\naccess a database of all potholes identified from the app, and will be maintained by local councils.\\nThe council can then analyse and schedule repairs based on the number of reports at a specific\\nlocation.\\nThe potential market for this system is vast. There is a constant issue with road conditions nationally\\nand internationally. The cost of repairs and compensation due to poor road conditions is in the\\nmillions for local councils. Bump aims to reduce these costs by enabling efficient data recording and\\nmore relevant data to be used in prioritising pothole repair.\\nProject Area: Sensor Technology\\nProject Technology: Java\\nProject Platform: Android\\n', 'Project Title: Rave Star\\nName: Raymond Michael Odeyemi\\nEmail: raymond.odeyemi2@mail.dcu.ie\\nProgramme: Computer Applications\\nSupervisor: Alistair Sutherland\\nThe game Rave Star is a 3 dimensional side scrolling platforming game for Android devices.

The app records data from the GPS and accelerometer sensors\\nduring a users car journey and identifies locations of potential potholes on a map, which can be\\naccessed by local councils who can then schedule repairs.\\nDetecting potholes on roads and deciding when they need to be repaired is a labour-intensive task.\\nCurrently the public report potholes through forms on county councils websites, by email or by phone.\\nThese all require manual user input and are prone to human error. Bump takes a participative\\nsensing approach to this.\\nAn app, running on an iPhone or Android smartphone, is started when the user starts a car journey.\\nThe app records the GPS location and the accelerometer motion. When the journey is completed the\\nuser signals this and the app processes the movement data to detect what are most likely to be\\npotholes. The user can also be prompted to confirm potholes to further improve accuracy. The\\nintensity and location of the potholes identified are then placed on a map. The map interface will\\naccess a database of all potholes identified from the app, and will be maintained by local councils.\\nThe council can then analyse and schedule repairs based on the number of reports at a specific\\nlocation.\\nThe potential market for this system is vast. There is a constant issue with road conditions nationally\\nand internationally. The cost of repairs and compensation due to poor road conditions is in the\\nmillions for local councils. Bump aims to reduce these costs by enabling efficient data recording and\\nmore relevant data to be used in prioritising pothole repair.\\n',\n",
