This is accomplished by comparing three possible layouts of\\na manufacturing facility with each layout having a unique machine-product dedication policy. The\\nlayouts are compared on two performance indices; process queuing times in each line and cycle\\ntimes of both production lines and of individual products. Comparison of the individual layouts is\\nachieved through the development of a simulation model of the three facility layouts which is then\\nused to perform a simulation study of the facilities’ behaviour over 10,000 hours. The data collected\\nfrom this simulation model is then used to calculate the performance indices of each layout.\\nFollowing the conclusion regarding the most optimal machine-product dedication policy for this\\nlayout, the production volume level is varied in order to find the optimal level for this layout and\\ncomment on its relationship with the machine-product dedication policy and processing times of the\\nstations. The manufacturing facility studied in this report is a facility with three processing lines, each\\nline having three processing operations. The facility produces three individual product types at a\\ndefined ratio of 6:2:1 of Product 1, Product 2 and Product 3 respectively.
