Clarity have been using sensing platforms in over 20 homes to collect data on their energy usage. The aim of this project was to provide a method to control the energy usage in the home using the smart actuation of electrical devices, thus closing the loop between the measuring and the control. Home automation is one of the buzzwords of the technology sector at the moment. There are many demonstrations of the advantages of this technology to be seen from a simple Google search. By using the wifi network already established in the home much of the extra infrastructure can be eliminated. The project uses a wifi connected Arduino with a switching circuit to control the power, combined with a Dreamplug computer to perform the decision on when to actuate. By using these low cost, low power devices the project aims to ensure that actuation element required in smart energy control can be cheap, and thus become profitable to the user in the long run. By smartly switching electrical devices so as to reduce waste and residual power the system can reduce the energy bill for the end user. My contribution to the project was to design and build the hardware required to actuate mains voltage power, and interface it with a prototype wifi connected Arduino. The signal for the control of the device is provided over the wifi network from the Dreamplug computer. The project was then extended to provide an example of the smart actuation that can be done with the system. The system can sense your arrival at home by means of your smartphone and actuate some predetermined action, such as turning on lights. Potentially this system can then be expanded to provide much more complex decision- making or to design artificial intelligence systems that could provide the whole home automation experience, while also reducing your carbon footprint.'}]"

Once the minds complete they can run it offline to check how it performs by downloading the world and running it with a mind program. It'll output the score it obtains and images of each action that their mind took. It also compiles a video of the minds run though the game.If they're happy with their mind they can then put it online where it can be run and its score marked on a scoreboard amongst other minds on the server.\", 'area': 'Artificial Intelligence, Graphics', 'technology': 'Java', 'platform': 'Windows'}, {'title': 'Wifi Enabled Energy Monitoring and Control in the Home', 'students': [{'name': 'Eoin Muldowney', 'email': 'eoin.muldowney2@mail.dcu.ie'}], 'programme': 'Electronic Engineering', 'supervisor': \"Prof. Noel O'Connor\", 'description': 'Home energy monitoring and subsequent reduction in energy usage has become an important area for research here in Ireland.
