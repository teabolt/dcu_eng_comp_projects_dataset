# DCU engineering and computing projects dataset

Every year Dublin City University (DCU) holds an Expo for computing and engineering students to show off their final year projects (https://www.dcu.ie/engineering_and_computing/Final-Year-Projects-Expo.shtml). Each Expo produces a .pdf file that talks about the Expo and gives descriptions of student projects.

In this repo it is proposed to extract all the data related to student projects (project title, programme, supervisor, descriptions, etc) from PDF files, and put that data into a structured format like CSV. The structured file should then be analysed using Data Science techniques.

Currently booklets from 2020 to 2011 are supported.

## Extraction steps

These are the steps that I took to extract data (some manual, some automated).

Linux has been used.

### Get all booklets

Run the `setup.sh` script.

Find the results in `/booklets`.

### Strip PDF's

Clean up the original PDF's and put the results in `/booklets_stripped`.

#### Remove pages

PDF's should have only those pages that have project descriptions, i.e. remove booklet cover, introduction, table of contents, list of projects.
Search online `pdf remove pages` for websites that provide this service.

Can also use the PdfTk multi-platform command line tool to remove pages. (see https://superuser.com/a/517993)

#### Remove margins

PDF's should also be stripped of margins that contain the booklet header, page numbers, etc.

Search online `pdf crop` for websites or tools. May also need `pdf merge`.

### Convert PDF's to a text format (TODO)

Files should be converted from PDF to a text format (.txt, .csv, .xlsx) for easy parsing.

Need to accurately convert tables.

References:

- `pdftotext` linux tool
  ```
  find booklets_stripped/ -name *.pdf -exec echo {} \; -exec pdftotext {} \;
  mv booklets_stripped/*.txt text/
  ```
- Online results for `pdf to csv`
- Online results for `pdf to excel`

Alternatively just copy all the text from a stripped PDF (using CTRL+A), where it's possible to do a selection.

### Parse the data from text files (TODO)

Convert text or excel files into structured data.

Python and Jupyter Notebook may be good for this.

Adjust the source of data from the last step as needed.
E.g. in 2019 one of the projects had students all with different programmes. It was easier to just list all the programmes after the list of students (though we lose information about which student is in which programme, that is not so necessary).
For small anomaly cases, it's best to just adjust the data, instead of writing extra logic.

Also perform data "canonicalization" (standardisation or normalization) in this step. Ensure that data is clean and ready to use.

https://pythex.org/ is very useful for testing out regular expressions.

### Analyse or use the dataset

Uses:

- https://github.com/teabolt/dcu_project_search_frontend

Other ideas:

- See trends in project areas, technologies over the years.
- Check history of supervisors' projects.
- Check if a project has been done before by searching through the titles and descriptions.
- Count number of projects per year
- Count number of projects of each supervisor.
