The app records data from the GPS and accelerometer sensors during a users car journey and identifies locations of potential potholes on a map, which can be accessed by local councils who can then schedule repairs. Detecting potholes on roads and deciding when they need to be repaired is a labour-intensive task. Currently the public report potholes through forms on county councils websites, by email or by phone. These all require manual user input and are prone to human error. Bump takes a participative sensing approach to this. An app, running on an iPhone or Android smartphone, is started when the user starts a car journey. The app records the GPS location and the accelerometer motion. When the journey is completed the user signals this and the app processes the movement data to detect what are most likely to be potholes. The user can also be prompted to confirm potholes to further improve accuracy. The intensity and location of the potholes identified are then placed on a map. The map interface will access a database of all potholes identified from the app, and will be maintained by local councils. The council can then analyse and schedule repairs based on the number of reports at a specific location. The potential market for this system is vast. There is a constant issue with road conditions nationally and internationally. The cost of repairs and compensation due to poor road conditions is in the millions for local councils. Bump aims to reduce these costs by enabling efficient data recording and more relevant data to be used in prioritising pothole repair.",

It has the capacity to save an incomprehensible amount of lives and to improve the quality of many more and while the process has not yet been perfected there have been many processes identified which may make it all the more achievable. One such process is electrospinning. Electrospinning is defined as a process by which a charged polymer jet is extruded through an electric field to grounded collector, resulting in a fibrous membrane which mimics the diverse microarchitecture of the extracellular matrix, a natural support for cells in vivo. Due to the large array of stresses and strains experienced by the extracellular matrix in vivo it is imperative to understand how these electrospun membranes behave in similar circumstances. This study explored how these electrospun membranes of both random and aligned fibers behave under tensile strain by way of tensile testing and imagery under an SEM. The application of tensile strain within the SEM was made possible due to a custom device designed and fabricated for the purposes of this study. It was found that the deformation witnessed was more complex than first imagined. Some membranes deformed as expected resulting in elongated fibers and a reduced fiber diameter however some membranes also showed no visible change in morphology possibly indicating a variation of strain levels across the membrane.",

In this project, a remote, flexible and customisable software platform has been designed with a Beaglebone Black, which enables users to change and personalise the hardware on their robots (wheels, sensors etc.), without any coding skills. Instead, they select their hardware from a range of options on a remote interactive display (installed on their desktop), which is also used to control the robot. Many benefits can be gained from the availability of cheap, customisable robots, for example in war zones, where robots are already being used to detect landmines. Unfortunately, developing these robots requires strong software skills, making them inaccessible to the general public. Because of the time constraints of this project, software was only written to control a small range of hardware devices (one sensor, one set of motors), but the robot’s software infrastructure and the remote interactive display is in place so that the project can easily be expanded to incorporate a wide range of hardware devices, which more experienced users could develop by themselves. All of the software for this project is designed using C++ objects, and remote communication between the robot and desktop display is achieved via a webserver. This project has also brought to light the difficulty of creating a customisable platform such as this for commercial deployment. No hardware device is the same, and designing software for each new device brings different challenges – as demonstrated in this project. Designing a platform for every single hardware device available on the market is impossible because there are just too many, but a product with a finite set of options could prove very useful, especially for educational purposes.",

One challenge here will be to download the data efficiently so that advertisers’ web servers are not overburdened with requests. Data captured will include features like car name/model/year/price/ engine size/mileage etc. These are the main qualities that will affect the sale price. The second part of this project is storing the downloaded data on a web server and developing a model from it.

The goal was not to actually produce the product, but to develop the conceptual framework to support the production of an e-Supply Chain Management (e-SCM) system using advanced product-design techniques and open source visualisation tools. Despite Ireland’s recent recessionary difficulties, SMEs account for 98% of all businesses and employ two-thirds of all private sector workers, thus the country depends on them to generate the jobs that will contribute to our sustained economic recovery. Through interviews and interaction with local SMEs it was found that many firms did not comprehend the potential benefits technology could have on their business. The project focused on these firms and their failure to implement technology, undertaking a detailed research review and market analysis identifying the rewards to be gained by the use of hi-tech tools particularly within the area of SCM. The Stanford D design framework was used to analyse this research and create the conceptual design of an e-SCM system. The concept was then tested, a business model canvas was created and potential funding options assessed in order to support the future development of such a product. The conceptual system identified Demand Management as a particular area for commercial opportunity of an e-SCM tool for SMEs. It highlighted how, through increased information sharing, firms can reduce variance across their supply chain networks. Thus, these measures can save SMEs money and enhance relationships with both customers and suppliers. This conceptual system has the potential to provide Ireland’s SMEs with the affordable tools and information needed to grow and develop through optimisation of their supply chain and in turn contribute to the growth and recovery of the Irish economy.",

Following discussion with staff of the case study company, it was decided that improvements in the picking process were essential to fix this problem. Using the Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing methodologies of DMAIC, the problem was measured and analysed, in order to determine the most affected areas. Pareto’s rule states that 80% of the problems are as a result of 20% of the causes; therefore, working on the most affected areas would result in a more efficient outcome. These areas underwent a further analysis to detect the root causes of the problem, using Fishbone Diagrams. An implementation plan was drawn up for the company to implement changes to the two most affected areas in the warehouse. Some changes have been made accordingly and have already shown improvements to the reduction of Found in Warehouse products. The implementation plan has been predicted to reduce the Found in Warehouse products by at least 40%.

This allows a user to discover their way through a city simply and organically. Using the power of tagging and image processing algorithms, my application aims to deliver the highest quality pictures and results to the user. These algorithms aim to stop the user being shown blurry, out of focus, or over saturated images. The user will see only the best quality crowdsourced images.

The tertiary education market is highly competitive with universities and institutes looking to distinguish themselves with a unique selling point to draw in and retain students. EyeStudy is an application that involves the use of Data Analytics and Data Mining techniques in the education sector. These advanced techniques are used to identify key classifiers/features that impact the probability of a student’s successful completion of a module. This data driven approach enables EyeStudy to predict how likely a student is to pass or fail their examinations based on their own activity with the Virtual Learning Environment. EyeStudy trains a Support Vector Machine with data of previous cohorts of students who have taken the same course and through various kernels identifies patterns of student behaviour which lead to the success and failure of a module. The identification of these various classifiers and real time predictions gives a lecturer the opportunity to step in and aid students toward success. EyeStudy has the ability to increase student retention, as well as enhancing a student’s academic performance.",

Medical imaging began with two-dimensional data in the form of x-ray images but then moved on to volumetric datasets, generated by modalities such as MR and CT, which are generally viewed as individual slices. The aim of this project is to use an online rendering API, WebGL, to create a remote access tool for viewing medical image data in 3D. The Marching Cubes algorithm was chosen as the surface extraction algorithm for this project. The Marching Cubes algorithm uses an imaginary cube consisting of 8 voxels, 4 voxels from two adjacent slices. An 8-bit index is calculated for each cube and this is used to look up triangle edges from a table. After it has determined how the surface intersects with the first cube location, it then moves to the next cube location and repeats the process until the entire volume has been traversed. In this way, the algorithm generates a mesh representation of the surface of interest which can then be rendered using conventional 3D graphics hardware. This project uses WebGL to visualise the data so that radiologists can access the data remotely to give a diagnosis quickly and easily.",

This project provides of a comprehensive literature review which assesses key issues within a supply chain, focusing on the bullwhip phenomenon and means in which to dampen its effects. A simulation model was developed to imitate a supply chain with a reverse logistics aspect. The simulation developed for this project was created using ExtendSim which a commerical software tool for creating simulation models of discrete and continuous systems. The potential for this simulation model to be used as an educational tool was also analysed by creating an interface within Microsoft Excel which allows users to vary certain factors within the simulation model. The results found that within the supply chain, the bullwhip effect is magnified within companies situated previous to the re-entry location of the recycled products. It was also found that the rate at which these products are re-entered into the system does not have a significant impact on inventory turnover rates. The significant variable found was the percentage of materials which are reintroduced into the system. It was concluded that the educational tool worked to highlight the mechanisms of the bullwhip phenomenon to students with a basic prior knowledge of the effect but would require a degree of optimisation to adequately educate those lacking any knowledge of this area. On completion of this project, there remain areas in which future study can be conducted. The simulation model could be developed to allow multiple re-entry locations throughout the supply chain along with improved flow of information between activities to further represent their reaction to alterations in demand. As for the educational tool aspect of this project, it is recommended that further development be conducted on the excel interface so that it will clearly explain the impact of variations within a reverse supply chain on the bullwhip phenomenon.",

The goal was to ultimately provide a learning resource or toolkit that could be used by amateur or professional security enthusiasts. Many different interesting ideas and techniques are explored along the way. The main rootkit functionality researched and developed is the following: • Installation of a rootkit • Accessing the system call table • Modifying system calls • Implementing a key logger • Hiding the rootkit module and files • Network traffic sniffing • Data exfiltration • Remote hidden access • Affecting user space functions • Privilege escalation • Detection/mitigation The final tool is called maK_it and was created on the CentOS linux distribution. It allows a party to maintain root access to a Linux host computer in a stealthy way once installed. It can be used for information reconnaissance and remote hidden access to a compromised machine.

This is done through scanning the barcode of an item, selecting the required size, shape or colour and querying the retailers’ database. The benefit of the application is that customers will not require staff to individually check for item availability. Some retail chains exist as franchises of each group therefore stock levels are not shared between the individual locations. Since the data for items is identical stock information for multiple locations will also be provided. One of the key features will also allow users to find the nearest location where an item is available if the current store does not have the particular item in stock. Using the smart phones GPS position and the coordinates of the nearest store. The benefit to the retailer is that it will highlight missed opportunities with regards to sales.

This project concerns the automation of the mass comparator. This involves the swapping of test and reference masses and reading in data from the mass comparator. This data is then analysed following either ABBA or ABA methodology. The analysed data is then compiled into a report along with other details entered about the mass. This is all done using the graphical programming language LabVIEW. A programme is developed in LabVIEW to communicate with both the mass comparator and the motor which controls the swapping of masses. The programme controls which mass it is measuring according to the ABBA or ABA protocol.

Upon inspection it was discovered that the machine produced aspects of TIMWOOD waste. In consultation with the company, it was determined that best course of action would be to implement a lean approach to resolve the issue. The issues that were identified are a consequence of poor chute design and an incompetent sample collection process. The chute design leads to acceptable parts becoming contaminated, and labelled as waste parts. The sample collection process was found to be inaccurate and inconsistent, which lead to over processing for the operator, causing additional labour content. A DMAIC approach was used to define the problem, measure its impact, analyse possible solutions, improve the current design and ensure the implemented solution operates as intended. Concepts such as air blades, an indexing belt and a slide were considered to help eliminate the waste and improve the sample shot collection process. Automating the process however seemed like a more appropriate solution. Using the combination of a slide and a conveyor belt to automate the process of capturing a sample shot helped eliminated human interactions with the machine. This eradicated the waste and the labour content associated with the process, potentially saving ‚Ç¨23,660 on product waste per annum and reducing labour content by 223.9 hours per annum allowing for the allocation of more hours for the operator to perform further tasks. In conclusion a lean approach was applied to an issue arising in a pharmaceutical company, the DMAIC cycle was used to identify the problem and produce a suitable solution to resolve the issue, part waste and labour content were reduced as a result.",

Instead of buying several analogue pedals one could purchase a relatively inexpensive embedded computer and programme the effects, offering a greater degree of customisation.

The filtering codes were written using SuperCollider, which was also installed on the device, and which can process and affect the guitar signal from the USB device in real time. The distortion effect can be toggled on and off as well as altered during play, using external buttons on a breadboard attached to the Beaglebone Black which communicates with SuperCollider using code written in Python. This is a desirable rig for any music fan or hobbyists with an interest in coding, who want a greater degree of control over their effects, or simply want to save money on high end distortion pedals.",

These belts are contained within drives that are part of a gauging device called the “Equator” system. The Equator fixture is an innovative creation by Renishaw plc. Accelerated life testing is carried out in Renishaw to determine the machines true capabilities and limitations. Inconsistent results were being gathered from the tension tests carried out by the current method. It was hypothesised that these inconsistencies were related to the test method put in place, which involved plucking the belt with an Allen key. The method was investigated and factors affecting the results were highlighted. A number of tests were conducted in order to find the optimum test conditions that would produce the most repeatable results. It was predicted that a plucking device would help eliminate human and technical factors that were affecting the results. Using a plucking device would also ensure the same force is applied at the same belt position every time. A variety of concepts were considered for the plucking device with the optimal design being manufactured. This device was tested in order to identify its capabilities and examine the readings produced. To increase the reliability of the measurements, a number of modifications were made to the plucking device to improve its overall configuration. In accordance with the initial expectations, the plucking device reduced the measurement uncertainty in the readings gathered, which meant the statistical dispersion of the readings were reduced. The findings support the prediction that by substituting the plucking device for the Allen key in the procedure, that it would allow a verified test method to be put in place, thus improving the continuity of the belt tension readings. Future work is discussed with many suggestions provided on ways to further improve the plucking device. Further testing is recommended in order to determine the improvements over a prolonged time frame.",

The player is given a finite amount of pixels that they can use to design a character and two weapons; the player is then released into a world in search of more pixels to add to their character. The game is based around per pixel collision detection, so many of the obstacles in the game can be overcome with a particular character design, such as making the character small to fit in narrow gaps or making the character large to fight off enemies. Different designs also have different benefits; larger characters are slow and can’t jump very high but have high defence while small characters are fast with low defence. The player can acquire more pixels by killing enemies and finding “Pixel Packs”, they can then add these pixels to their character or weapon designs or alternatively use them to increase their weapon strength or life bar. The game takes place in an underground world full of monsters and traps; the player must use their designs to solve puzzles, defeat enemies and bypass obstacles throughout the world in an effort to find their way back to the surface. The player is able to create multiple character and weapon designs and is capable of switching between these different designs on the go.",

All experiments included in this report make use of widely available technology such as smartphones in an attempt to either increase the accuracy of existing experiments or to measure phenomena that would previously have required more expensive equipment. Five experiments have been designed in total, each covering a different topic and each presenting a new experimental approach. For each of the five experiments, testing has been carried out to evaluate their accuracy and to determine their viability as a scientific experiment to aid student learning. All five experiments tested show potential but and could be improved upon with further experimentation and greater understanding of the sources of error. This project found through extensive testing that DIY type experiments can be as accurate and, in some cases, more accurate than their traditional counterparts. The main conclusion of this report is that smart devices have a great deal of potential, and can be used effectively as a tool, replacing specialist equipment, in experiments that can aid learning.",

Microbubbles are defined as having a diameter of less than 1mm but greater than 1Œºm. Microbubble technology is an expanding field and can be found in numerous industries throughout the world. These can vary from aeration for fish farming to ultrasound imaging and drug delivery in the medical sector. An in-depth literature review was performed to understand what microbubbles actually are, what properties they have that make them desirable for industry, the various methods of generating them and the mathematical theory behind bubble generation. After evaluating various concepts a final test rig was designed and manufactured. This rig did produce bubbles; however, these were too large to be classified as microbubbles. The test results indicate that the rig could potentially generate bubbles with a diameter less than 1mm by altering the operating conditions but further testing and experimentation is required.",

As a result of this, conference publications have arisen out of this work. The indoor environment presents its own unique challenges due to the presence of clutter like tables and chairs. New developments in energy-efficient wireless communications and location and tracking algorithms have created a greater demand for accurate propagation models that can include as much of the physics of the environment as is possible but run in reasonable compute times. This model is based on the Volume Electric Field Integral Equation (VEFIE) formulation. Numerical techniques such as the Method of Moments and a weak-form discretisation are applied to produce a system of linear equations which can then be solved iteratively. We show how an iterative process accelerated by appropriate use of the Fast Fourier Transform is a superior method for the solution of these systems. In addition it is explained how a simple pre-multiplication step can force the iterative solver to focus on computing the solution for important values further accelerating the run time of the model. Numerical results are presented validating the model against the Mie series and Uniform Theory of Diffraction. Simulations showing the advantages of this model over conventional, ray tracing, models are presented along with sample building simulations.",

The piezo-electric fan actuator solves the problem of thermal management with results showing increased air flow and heat dissipation, coupled with lower power usage and much lower noise pollution when compared to a rotary fan sized for the same application. Piezoelectric devices are not new to the world of technology, in fact their use is widespread across many industries such as measurement systems, telecommunications, to name but a few. The Piezoelectric fan is, however, relatively new. It is composed of a thin blade bonded to a PCB which incorporates a piezo-ceramic patch. The device is driven at resonance to provide maximum deflection and airflow. Testing is required to provide accurate scalability per application. This project illustrates the design and specification of a low cost microcontroller based test bed to investigate the control of a piezoelectric fan blade. Frequency and deflection measurements are presented along with a critical review of the latest development in the field. The detailed design of the final test bed is outlined along with the events that led to its creation. CAD modelling, system wiring and the theories behind the final test bed measurement systems are presented. The final system is shown to have a relatively high accuracy of 3.125-5.15 Hz with a 95% confidence.This work seeks to benefit the development of this exciting technology.",

These types of touch sensors work either though self-capacitance, mutual capacitance or a mixture of both. There are many types of touch sensors but in recent years capacitive touch sensors have moved ahead of competing designs due to their higher accuracy, sensitivity and robust build quality. The sensors were designed using a software package called Ansys Q3D extractor. The software does numerical analysis on the sensors designed through the Method of Moments or the Finite Element Method. Before touch screen sensors were designed a number of tests to check the accuracy of the solver were performed using simple devices, with known theoretical formulae. The solver values were plotted against theoretical values to determine how accurate the solver that the software uses was. Possible sources of error were taken into account. Various different touch screens were then designed. The layers of these touch screens were then varied in size and material in order to come up with the most accurate value for each layer without impeding the build quality. Once these optimal values were gathered, they were then used to determine the sensing region at the centre and corner of the sensor. Both self-capacitance and mutual capacitance sensors were analysed. In the self-capacitance touch screens, the effects of bridge length on the sensitivity of the sensor were analysed.",

Loopman aims to bring comparable functionality to mobile Android devices by allowing you to record and generate multiple looping audio tracks and manipulate them individually during playback. Initially you are provided with four blank tracks that can play simultaneously, which you can then record audio to using the devices microphone, or generate melodies using a variety of synthesizers and sequencers. You will also be able to manipulate different aspects of each individual track as well as apply effects to them, as they are looping.

The application has a user login and there are two kinds of user: a standard user, the student, and an admin user, the teacher. The standard user sees a letter displayed at the top of the screen and has to draw and enter this, they are told whether they have drawn the letter correctly or incorrectly and are given the option to retry the same letter or move on through the rest of the alphabet. The admin user is shown the statistics of each of the standard users and therefore can instantly see which user is struggling and which is thriving. The admin user is also responsible for creating all the standard users accounts. Letter Checker was designed and developed to solve a problem based on a real need identified by a primary school teacher. The teacher finds it difficult to check the writing of around 30 students in real time, and for letter writing, correct formation/sequencing is as important as the final product. Letter Checker enables the teacher to monitor each student individually and provide additional support where necessary. It also enables the teacher to tailor the learning resources to suit individual learning needs based on student ability.",

A Manufacturing Flow Dashboard is a powerful system that gives a viewer the ability to analyse a system and make better analytical decisions. This FMS rig is a link up of six stations that is located in DCU, a flow dashboard has successfully been implemented on a static level to the FMS rig located in DCU which is made using a Microsoft Excel document. Data was taken from the FMS rig via controllers which are connected to it and macros were programmed using visual basic to work with this data to present it to a supervisor in a useful way to observe where optimisation could be made. The system made gives the viewer the ability to monitor the efficiency and the working time of each station of the FMS rig so problems can be spotted easily. This system will be able to spot possible problems that limit the FMS rig from being optimised or working at its best ability. A number of problems were also found while working on the rig between gathering the data from the rig to being able to use the data in the dashboard, which limited the potential of the project but possible solutions were identified for these problems in the future.",

Marathon and half-marathon training requires many hours of often monotonous training, with many runners turning to the music on their smartphones to alleviate the boredom of a long run. The main aim of the PaceMakr app is to slow down/speed up the tempo of the user’s music while they are jogging as their pace begins to deviate from their target speed supplied before the run. The change in tempo will make the user aware that they are below/above their target and motivate them to speed up/slow down. The music tempo will return to its original state as they return to their target speed/ time. The app will have two modes: Speed – The user chooses the average speed they wish to achieve for the run. They also choose a warm up period for the start of their run where tempo changes will not apply. If the user drops below their chosen speed after this period, the music tempo will begin to change. The further their pace drops below/rises above this speed, the further the tempo will drop/rise. This mode is for training runs where consistency of speed is important. Distance – The user chooses the distance they wish to run over the course of their jog. They also choose the time they wish to do it in. These two variables will be used during the jog to determine if the user is on course for completing their target distance within their target time. If they start to drop below/rise above this, the tempo of the music will gradually slow down/speed up. Again, this will motivate the user to speed up/slow down which will incrementally return their music tempo to the correct tempo as they return to their target speed.",

However, scanned handwritten documents, such as historical manuscripts that have been digitised, can only be searched on the basis of the meta-data associated with the scanned image, which is typically very sparse. Traditional OCR (optical character recognition) approaches to recognise words and index on this basis, will not work as they are optimised for printed characters. In such documents, words are individually segmented and their shape is described based on their contour. The resulting shape description is then used to match the same word across a collection, providing a way to build ‘hyperlinks across’ a scanned collection so that it can be browsed based on occurrences of the same word. Thus the goal of this project was to apply this approach to a very small collection of scanned documents from the Irish National Folklore Collection and on this basis a demo system was build for browsing this small collection.",

The project consists of two main phases, the first is the research phase in which we held a number of experiments to measure the effects of ambient lighting during a meditation cycle. We recorded the raw data which came from the EEG device and processed it to gain an insight into the effects of different colours during meditation, and secondly the effects of the rate of change of the said colours. The second phase of the project was the development phase. For this phase we have developed two mobile apps (iOS and Android). The purpose of these apps is to work in real time with a single channel EEG device and the bluetooth lights to improve a persons meditation and provide feedback based on each meditation session they have. The apps process the data which is read from the EEG device and change the lighting colours in real time to enhance the users meditation.

The Venturi Tube type microbubble generator was found to generate microbubbles with mean diameter of 100Œºm and for Rotation Chamber from 10 to 50Œºm. Compressed air was used to drive the system. A number of tasks had to be performed to complete specified objective including fluid flow simulation. Research fields included various microbubble generators, microbubble properties, and a supersonic compressible flow through a convergent-divergent (CD) nozzle. The CD nozzle had to be carefully analysed to determine a zone of lowest pressure values. Fluid flow simulations, using ANSYS Fluent, were performed to show the behaviour of fluid inside the CD nozzle. Fluid flow of the overall system, including rotation chamber, was also simulated to show the effect of nozzle injection angle change on flow behaviour. SolidWorks software was used to create 3-D models of CD nozzle, rotation chamber, and an assembly of a fully combined system. The hole was placed in the zone of lowest pressure, along the nozzle, for water suction which proved to be successful. Nozzle testing results, at 1 and 2bar, showed the generation of some microbubbles due to turbulence of the fluid at the nozzle exit, and if left for some time a cloud of bubbles was observed. Combination of the nozzle and chamber did seem to improve the result as more bubble-dense cloud was seen. An unexpected “fog” like phenomena appeared to form during test stage which was not explained or studied properly. The overall main objective of the project was met, although a very small amount of microbubbles have been generated.",

Within the design of this device, the feasibility of using rapid prototyping to create custom wrist splints was assessed. Patient adherence was focused on as it was identified as a major problem with upper extremity splinting. Method: To achieve this aim, background information on the injury in question, splinting techniques, rapid prototyping and the product design cycle was gathered. Using this information, a conceptual design was conceived. From this design a prototype was produced. Along with functional testing of this prototype in comparison to an over the counter splint, a finite element analysis was performed. Material testing of the PLA produced by the rapid prototype device was also performed, with a focus on how the mechanical properties are affected by fibre orientation. Results: The functional testing revealed that the new design performs better than the over the counter splint, but not as good as a control of no splint. The material testing resulted in a difference in mechanical properties with differing fibre orientations. The finite element analysis of the splint revealed a minimum factor of safety of 2.83. Conclusion: The design of a wrist splint and manufacture using rapid prototyping techniques to treat the common wrist sprain is a feasible process, one that with future improvement in technology could lead to astounding developments in the process of splinting.",

        "description": "The objective for this project is based on a Proof-of-Concept design for a medical alert device entitled In Case of Emergency (I.C.E.). The idea behind this project was to create a wrist device that incorporates an accelerometer to determine when a person has a fall or accident in the home. By measuring the amount of static acceleration due to gravity, we can determine the angle the device is tilted at with respect to the earth. The device can also pick up readings of whether someone has stopped moving for a significant length of time due to a sudden fall. From this, the accelerometer can send an alert signal from the wrist piece which then contacts the Response Centre. The response centre team will then contact the customer directly to see if they have had an accident. Failing that, their next of kin contact can be alerted. If neither of those options are successful, the appropriate emergency services are contacted immediately. Especially in Ireland, there is an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases, an ageing population and challenges to the sustainability of the healthcare system. The plan we hoped to achieve was to help and protect people in the home if an incident was to occur. Many emergency devices already installed in homes include only a panic button mechanism. In other cases, accelerometers are only installed in the likes of a mattress if an elderly person gets up in the middle of the night and doesn’t return to bed. Neither of these components are integrated into a system together as of yet.",

        "description": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. While CHD can be treated using medications and minimally invasive techniques, the best outcomes are associated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Many patients present CHD co-morbidly with other diseases which may render a autologous graft procedure impossible. An objective of much recent research has been to create an artificial biocompatible artery graft, seeded with the patient’s own cells, which may be used instead of homologous or xenologous grafts in such cases. Attempts at creating small diameter tissue engineered blood vessels have not been successful to date, with one of the leading problems being a mismatch in mechanical properties between the graft and the host tissue. In this project, a number of polymer (PHBV) scaffolds are created under differing electrospinning conditions, which are then mechanically tested and subjected to scanning electron microscopy. The images obtained are subjected to image analysis, using an image analysis program developed by the author as part of the module EE465, to determine the relationships between the electrospinning parameters and scaffold morphology. The overall objective is to attempt to create a scaffold with properties similar to that of human coronary artery tissue. However, it is found that in all that cases the mechanical properties of the electrospun scaffolds are far from what is required for coronary artery bypass grafts, being much stronger and more brittle than native coronary arteries. This difference is so pronounced that no variation of parameters is able to bring the scaffolds into line with tissue mechanical properties Hence it is concluded that this polymer, PHBV, is unsuited to the task of creating a tissue engineered coronary artery graft. However it may be suitable for use as a scaffold material for other body tissues, particularly ligaments, as these have tensile properties closer to that of electrospun PHBV.",

The installation, configuration and maintenance of these tools can impede the progress of a newcomer to Android application development. To tackle this issue, a web based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was created that provides easy access to a set of preconfigured Android development tools thus allowing the user to focus solely on application development. The JavaScript framework Sencha ExtJS was chosen to build the web interface as it provides modern UI widgets and cross platform browser compatibility. The server-side of the IDE which handles the project creation and compilation processes was built using the Java Servlet API which is part of the Enterprise Edition of Java (Java EE). Google Cloud Messaging was integrated with the IDE to notify the user on successful compilation of the Android application. Two Android applications were also created using the Android API in order to allow the web based IDE to communicate with the user’s mobile device. The first application enables the user to download and install the developed Android application on notification from the server, while the second application controls the broadcasting of real time logging information from the user’s phone to the web application.

The purpose of this project was to commission the laminar flow table within DCU, for the potential use in the study of fluid mechanics. In order to commission the rig, a series of experiments were carried out to calculate important flow parameters for the table such as the mass flow rates, velocity of the flow and most importantly the Reynolds number. Three different methods were used to find these parameters and the most accurate method was selected. Once the flow properties were found, a range of experiments were carried out. These experiments included; flow around a simple disc, flow around a bluff body and flow around an airfoil with an increasing angle of attack. Flow control through a pipe was also considered with experiments investigating the impact on a venturi and orifice meter. The results obtained from these experiments were compared with the theoretical data previously researched. In addition, some of the experiments were simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamic software. In conclusion the laminar flow table is a good visual tool to students studying fluid mechanics, but it does have its limitations. The results obtained match the appropriate theoretical data and the results found from running the simulated CFD models, but it was found that the table is very temperamental and consistent results were difficult to obtain.",

The idea behind the app is that user will set an alarm for a specific time and when the alarm triggers, the user will have to solve four puzzles to turn it off. The puzzles are two random maths questions, a colour pattern game, a reaction game, and a match the brick game. The reason the user has to solve puzzles so they can turn off the alarm is to make sure the user is fully awake before the alarm is dismissed. The social aspect of this alarm is that the user has the ability to request that an alarm be set for another phone that is using the app. This functionality of the app means that the user will have the ability to set group alarms. A scenario where this could be used is if a lecturer had a 9am class he could request that alarms be set for all the students in that particular class. The student would have the ability to reject the alarm if they wanted. I will be using Google Cloud messaging to connect the devices to each other.

This project was designed to create both types of tools and was broken up into two parts accordingly. The first involved investigating and developing VBA code for moving simple shapes in Excel to create simulations of mechanisms. Current animations are generally produced using Excel charts and are often of poor quality, slow moving or excessively jerky. It was found that Excel offers an easy to use platform for creating mechanism simulations and results in attractive simulations that may help students in their understanding of mechanism behaviour. The second part of the project involved researching, designing and building a system to allow the easy creation of stop-motion videos of Lego mechanisms. The system built repeatedly moves a 4-bar linkage mechanism by a small amount and triggers a camera so that a photo is taken after each step. MATLAB is then used to turn the series of pictures into a video file. The purpose of this is videos are blur-free when paused. It was found that the system produced good stop-motion videos. These videos may help enhance the understanding of mechanisms and may, in the future, be analysed further for educational purposes with video analysis software.",

Non-renewable energy resources such as coal, natural gas and petroleum are being used to generate energy for homes, businesses and transport. Ireland has many opportunities to tap into available renewable energies such as wind and solar. Questions continuously arise, however: why bother switching from traditional energy production to this cleaner method of energy production? What are the benefits? How much will it cost to change? The following report discusses the switch to a domestic solar hot water system, studies the effect of various system parameters, and assesses the financial implications in terms of payback times. The project allows the reader see the challenges, benefits and drawbacks of implementing a solar domestic hot water system. Several solar hot water models were developed using different parameters, thus allowing various comparisons to be carried out. The simulations were carried out using the software package SimSol. The package allowed the user to vary key parameters in order to identify the potential energy savings and CO2 emission avoidance (reduction in carbon footprint). The results obtained from six case studies identified an optimal and feasible model. This model produced 47.33% of the total energy required for the solar domestic hot water system, and resulted in monetary savings of ‚Ç¨306.06 per year. These savings, however, resulted in a very long payback time, approximately 20 years. Consequently, the recommendation made is that this particular system should not be implemented in Ireland due to the excessive payback time. It is important to note that financial savings are not the only motivation; other important benefits include the reduction in personal carbon footprint.",

The generation system eliminates contaminants within the water, to produce purified water that meets the critical quality attributes and release specifications for the drug product requirements. The management of the upgrade involves a series of phases from designing the system through to the validation of the installation. The aim of the project was to inspect the project process including the reasons for the upgrade, the specifications required, the cooperation between the pharmaceutical company, the contractor and the qualifications involved. The function of the purification equipment and the type of system is explained along with the analysis of the components that make up the final system. The validation of the system is also illustrated, step by step. Attaining an understanding of purified water and the systems used by pharmaceutical companies to achieve relevant qualities of water was needed before inspecting the management of the project. Learning the various preparations that are pursued by AbbVie to obtain the requirements of the upgrade and the specifications of the product was the beginning stage of researching the project management steps involved. Different documentation used in the design proposal were revised and analysed to acquire the advancement of the new generation system. Once the criteria of the project were understood, the duties of the contractor were investigated. This included the final design of the new system along with the vendor’s responsibilities to follow the installation with a validation plan. Planning the project and complying with specific quality standards are key aspects to completing the installation of the system.

This is achieved through the implementation of both a mobile application and tradition web browsing experience and as such, can accommodate the diverse range of devices available within smaller organisations. Rotate is software provided as a service, that allows the management of very small businesses to define upcoming work schedules for employees and have this communicated directly to their staff. Using Rotate, employees can then view up-to-date information regarding their upcoming schedules and as the application is hosted in the cloud, changes are implemented in real-time. This, coupled with a mobile application for accessibility, means employees can have their schedules pushed directly to their smartphone, ensuring they remain up-to-date with their working commitments. Rotate caters for employees requesting holidays and/or adjustments to their work schedules. This is communicated through the service for review and these changes take effect automatically when approved, ensuring all parties are aware of their current commitments. In addition, Rotate also offers the ability to revisit past staff schedules, providing a level of recourse for management in the event of arising issues. Management then have the capability to export schedules from Rotate to excel, making the output easy to integrate with existing automated payroll systems. As Rotate is a cloud application, it can be made available to multiple organisations, allowing each to utilise the service independant of one another. This makes Rotate a solution that can be scaled to accommodate a growing user-base and as the client has no infrastructure to manage and maintain, updates can be easily implemented on the server-side. This makes Rotate an ideal solution for organisations who may not have the resources available to implement a similar solution internally.",

        "description": "Materials that can be exposed to large elastic deformations display dramatic instabilities. This report investigated the instability’s experienced by long slender elastic rods when subjected to streching and twisting. The instability’s expected were the sudden formation of knots along the length of the elastic rod. The procedure undertaken to design a suitable rig for applying large amounts of shear to incompressible elastic rods and obtaining reliable data on the formation of these instabilities for various cross sections was discussed in detail. Following this the procedure used to investigate the modelling of the formation of such instabilities was discussed using the results obtained from the designed rig and stress strain data for simple tension experiments on each test specimen. The strain energy of the various test specimens were analysed and modelled using a simple strain energy functions derived from Mooney’s and Rivlin’s theory on large elastic deformations. A modified strain energy function (buckling model) was used to investigate whether or not, the non-linear instabilities experienced by long slender elastic rods could be modelled and predicted when subjected to large amounts of shear. The result of this investigation concluded that the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function is an excellent model for characterising the strain energy of elastic rods. The modified strain energy function used with coefficients derived from this fit was used to model the formation of these non-linear instabilities. A second test was done by working backwards to the strain energy function from the buckling model, with the coefficients used for predicting the stress strain relationship used as parameters in the Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function. This allowed comparisons between the accuracy of the fit of the buckling model and the fit of the original Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function, upon which, the buckling modelled was developed.",

Once quantum computing becomes a reality these methods will be much easier to defeat, thanks to clever randomised algorithms proposed by Peter Shor. Lockbox is a cloud storage application, similar to Dropbox, that uses a form of encryption based on a different mathematical problem – the shortest vector problem. It is not known to be vulnerable to quantum attacks, and the implementation (Ntru) is also much faster than other public/private keypair based schemes. The user stores files locally on their device, which are then synchronised to their account on the Lockbox server. The encryption aspects of the application are invisible to the user. In terms of technology used, the server is an Ubunto 12.04 LTS box, the encryption library used is Ntru, and the SSL software is CyaSSL. By default, Android uses OpenSSL, which contains no quantum proof handshake mechanism (unless we disregard perfect forward secrecy). Replacing the SSL stack with CyaSSL was non-trivial and required building a modified Android kernel. The actual server application was handwritten in Java rather than using an existing web server. It was planned to use Nginex, or failing that, Apache, however integrating CyaSSL with either was not possible. For storing the users files, CouchDB was used, a NoSQL database.",

The current solutions of clothing banks on the market at the moment are too easily robbed and interfered with. Saint Vincent DePaul (SVP) wants to lead the way in taking action against this issue and have teamed up with DCU in the hope of putting an end to this problem. This union of these two groups led to the formation of the project. The aims of the project are to: • Evaluate the weaknesses of current textile (clothing) banks. • Develop possible concepts to improve the security of the bank. • Test and evaluate an optimum solution against the initial requirements of the project. The project identifies the weaknesses in the current solution of the clothing banks: • The large gap that can be accessed by setting the current Inlet mechanism to the midway point, allows for easy removal of the bank’s contents. • On the Outlet it was found that ‘Jimmying’ the door and breaking visible locks were the main factors in the contents being stolen. From this weakness analysis, concepts are developed in order to overcome the problem. The project presents three viable concepts and then uses a weighted matrix to determine the best concept. The optimum concept determined is a sliding drawer based mechanism with a trap door. The concept eliminates the security hazards mentioned above, while also keeping the design simple, safe and easy to use. The design also incorporates reinforcements on the Outlet and motorised locks. The concept can be easily fitted to the current solution. The solution is modelled on SolidWorks and is finally tested under various stresses and strains. Results proved the solution to be a viable and sound concept to take onto the next phase. This decision however lies with SVP upon the final presentation of the finished project to them.",

The aim of this project was to develop a detection system using image analysis for enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria in environmental waters. Samples were taken from different locations and mixed with different chemical solutions acting as food for bacteria, which was later sampled using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method. In this project a system was developed for use of a fluorescence method to detect the presence of the bacteria in solutions, by exposing them to a UV light source with a wavelength of less than 400 nanometres. The device developed consisted of three different sub-systems (incubator, vision and control). Thermal energy was supplied by the incubator to heat up the sampled solutions so that the growth of bacteria increased while images of the sample fluorescence were captured with a web-camera (vision system). Image processing and analysis algorithm was programmed in Matlab for capturing and counting the coliforms from the fluorescence within each image. The vision system and heating were both monitored and controlled via a microprocessor connected to a PC. A Wixel was used as the microprocessor and the programming language used was C. This report presents the reader a good understanding of how coliform bacteria were used as indicators for water quality. How the developed device was designed and controlled via Matlab are also presented. The report is sectioned into chapters which document each step that was used for the completion of the project.",

A PID controller is a control loop feedback mechanism regularly used in industrial control systems to optimise speed of response, steady state error and stability. This project is a real time application of a ball and beam control system based on LabView software interfaced to an arduino platform. The benefit of using Labview is that it allows users to see the performance of the system and how the system is controlled. The ball and beam is a common feedback control system application. It is easy to build and it is a good example of a dynamic system that is used for demonstration purposes. The system consists of a ball, a beam, an ultrasonic sensor, a potentiometer and a DC motor which connects directly to a gear box. The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the position of the ball and the potentiometer is used to detect the angle of the beam, the signals are used as feedback information when controlling ball position. Torque generated by the motor through the gearbox will cause the beam to tilt thereby moving the ball to the desired position. The system was simulated using Matlab Simulink in order to test the controllability and stability of the system. The mathematical model for the open-loop dynamic system is a fourth order system with two real negative poles and two poles at the origin.",

        "description": "The aim of the project was to optimise the chassis of an electric vehicle. The chassis of the vehicle is designed and manufactured from plain carbon steel sheets with the thickness of 6mm, 8mm and 10mm. Parts are laser cut and bent into shape before welding. Manufacturing the chassis with varieties of material thickness presents a high cost of material and higher scrap rate during production. As this is a low price vehicle, reducing the cost of production and scrap quantity is essential, and one approach is to manufacture all the chassis components from a single sheet thickness (e.g. 6mm sheet of Plain Carbon Steel). In order to decide on the most suitable material thickness to be used in producing the chassis parts, a replica chassis model for each of the material thicknesses was developed in the Solidworks solid modelling package. The performance of each model was simulated in a virtual environment using finite element analysis (FEA). The chassis models were simulated to determine the internal stresses due to the weight of the batteries and different skip loads. The boundary conditions were the reactions from the ground at each wheel and were common to all models. The results were analysed with regards to the yield stress of the steel [210Mpa]. The simulation results for the initial designs show that the maximum stress experienced by each model is higher than the specified limit. To improve the performance of the models, the parts experiencing the highest stress were redesigned. With the new design concepts implemented, the models were updated and analyses, the new solutions revealed a much improved performance lowering the maximum stresses to acceptable levels. Optimisation decisions were made by comparing the performances of the 3 replica models and show that the use of 8mm for all components would be suitable.",

The player directly controls an astronaut (strapped into a thruster harness to allow for multiple axes of movement) floating in an Earth orbit environment along with a collection of objects and items such as tools, boxes, debris and various other bits of clutter an astronaut might find himself around while performing extra vehicular activities. The player can jet around and turn using short, vectored thrusts but must be sure to take care, as his momentum and inertia will not decrease on its own in the vacuum of space. Collisions with other objects can cause unpredictable results as the force of the impact could cause both astronaut and object to spin off in different directions.

OpenCV is an open source computer vision package, with which it is possible to utilise pre-trained commands for tasks such as face or eye detection. The system was developed through ‘C’ language programming on a laptop. A webcam is used as the chosen monitoring device, and the characteristic used to identify sleep is the length of time the driver’s eyes are closed.

        "description": "The aim of the project was to design and manufacture a fully functional automated camera stand that supports stereo vision with a variable baseline. Stereo vision is a technique of comparing two images of a scene from different viewpoints and extracting 3D information from the scene. Most stereo vision systems have a fixed baseline. This is the distance between the two cameras. Increasing the baseline between the two cameras also increases the accuracy of depth/height information extracted using stereo vision. However in systems with large baselines objects in the close vicinity leave the cameras view and are not processed by the cameras. Due to this, depth information cannot be extracted from these. Automatically changing this baseline can solve this problem and greatly aid in the techniques used in stereo vision. This invokes the need for a high accuracy camera stand with a controlled variable baseline. The positions of the two cameras had to be controlled accurately for the process of stereo vision. The length of the baseline is essential knowledge for the stereo algorithms. A motor controlled stand with cameras mounted to lead screws and software was developed and tested to find the stands capabilities. The method for controlling the position of the cameras is using a lead screw setup to ensure high accuracy. Results aided in the conclusion that the camera stand would support stereo vision techniques due to the accuracy of the known baseline dimension that is used in the stereo vision algorithms.",

        "description": "The emergence of sensor networks combined with the increasing availability of MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) devices has created a demand for robust and reliable sensors. The aim of this project is to design and assemble a low cost solution for testing MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) devices and to evaluate the performance of the resultant test bed using a microchip with on board sensor fusion capabilities. This project details the progression of the development from a design concept to the manufacture of the physical rig, and an evaluation of the actual performance of the device compared to the designed performance. A 3D model of the rig was produced utilising the CAD package SolidWorks and working drawings were drafted from the model for the manufacturing technician. An Arduino UNO microprocessor is used as the controller for the rig as it is a low cost low power device with a wide range of functionality. A gyroscope and accelerometer will be used for evaluating the rig. The device contains three accelerometers and three gyroscopes that can achieve 9 degrees of freedom when combined with combinatorial sensor fusion. The code was developed on the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The device uses three stepper motors for open loop control of each axis. The completed test bed comprises of three motors arranged in orthogonal directions to each other and is capable of rotating in three dimensions. The results of the testing show that the rig is a viable method of extrapolating data from a sensor in a controlled environment. Thus, the test bed is capable of providing an environment for sensor fusion development if combined with an appropriate control algorithm and independent sensors.",

Displays created using the POV effect can offer low cost, low power, high quality solutions for presenting images and video when compared with other methods. The aim of this project is to use the POV effect to create a device, capable of displaying twodimensional static and animated images. This dissertation documents the different stages in the development of a POV display. The principles of operation are explained throughout and these principles are ultimately employed to create a two-dimensional display. Experiments are used to explore minimum pixel size, animation frame rates and the accuracy of shading levels which can be applied to images. Areas where improvements can be made to the display have been identified. Methods of increasing image resolution through the use of smaller LEDs and increasing the accuracy of shading levels are applied as a means to demonstrate how the operational limitations of the system can be improved.",

Filters play an important role in modern industries such as water treatment, bioprocessing and food and beverage manufacturing. Over a period of continuous use, filters can become fouled as particles deposit on the filter surface. The fouling reduces the permeate flux and can eventually lead to critical conditions with no flow through the filter. By gas sparging filters, the rate of permeate flux can be increased over time, resulting in a more efficient filter and reducing the need to clean or replace filters. From previous studies bubble flow and in particular slug flow have been shown to delay the filter clogging. Experiments were done as part of this project in order to investigate bubble flow by visually inspecting the bubble formations. A computational analysis of the bubble flow was carried out using the Fluent CFD software in order to complement the experimental analysis. Another aim of the project was to investigate the pore size of the provided filter for which there was no information. The results showed that contrary to previous studies churn flow provides the highest shear stress which results in a more efficient permeate flux. The average pore size of the filter was found to be 0.0304 microns. It can be concluded that the results found were inaccurate due to the setup of the computational model. An explanation for the inaccuracy was down to the lack of elements in the mesh. Another reason was the mesh geometry was too short to allow the bubble to form fully.",

When studying maths, working through examples is the key to understanding a concept. Because teachers and lecturers do not always have the time to help students when they are confused, the student must turn to alternatives. The aim of this project was to design a tool to assist these students in understanding differentiation rules, by allowing students to work through multiple examples at their own pace. A differential solver was designed using Visual Basic (VBA) in Excel. The user can choose a differential rule they wish to work with, open the relevant worksheet, and see how equations are differentiated using that rule. The user can also modify these equations by changing the function name, independent variable and constants to whatever they wish. The solver is split over five separate worksheets. The ‘Basic 1’ worksheet was the first worksheet to be created and was then used as a template for the other worksheets. A rough design of the interface was made and then code was added in order for the scroll bar, input cells and output cells to function properly. After this worksheet was built, it was rigorously tested for errors that could be potentially copied over to the next worksheet. After all errors were corrected, the next worksheet was designed, built and tested. Each worksheet was made in this way until all were completed. When they were all complete, the worksheets were beta tested in order to get opinions on how effective the worksheets were. Feedback from the beta testing was used to improve the worksheets, where possible.",

Because of their unique properties, solitons would allow transmission through fibre optic media over long distances with very little signal degradation. The Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation is a partial differential equation that describes the propagation of light through a nonlinear medium such as a fibre optic cable. It is important that one has fast and accurate algorithms for solving it numerically to enable accurate design work in practical timescales. The purpose of this project is to investigate methods for numerically computing solitons and to compare them in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

One of the main methods of increasing energy efficiency of a house is to increase its air tightness and stop warm air escaping from the house. However, improving the air tightness of a house brings its own problems. The build-up of stale air within the house can have serious negative health implications for the occupants of the house. The build-up of stale air can also damage the building fabric itself by causing the accumulation of condensation on cold surfaces such as walls, ceilings and windows. The purpose of this project was to investigate the use of a Mechanical Vent Heat Recovery (MVHR) system and see how efficient the system would be if installed. The investigation consisted of testing at various temperatures to and from the MVHR unit. The results for testing at controlled temperatures supplied to the MVHR unit produced high efficiency values. The MVHR system is highly efficient in these cases where the temperature to and from the system is controlled. On the other hand, for testing in real world situations where the air temperatures fluctuated due to local weather conditions the efficiency calculations were inconclusive.",

The biomedical field is constantly growing and improving and with 123 years of hip replacements there are still new designs and procedures being developed. The finite element method is commonly used to examine structural analysis problems but is a very useful tool in the biomedical field for analysis of orthopaedic implants where it is not possible to directly measure structural responses following implantation. The aim of this project is to build a validated 2D finite element model of a total hip arthroplasty. A validated finite element model of the THA allows predictions of the THA behaviour in cases of extreme loading. The use of 2D finite element models instead of 3D models in stress analysis will greatly reduce computational costs and processing time. An experimental rig of a THA was restored to working order. The rig consisted of a synthetic femur, Charnley prosthesis, strain gauges and pneumatic cylinders. Strain measurements were obtained from the experimental rig and a 2D finite element model representative of the experimental rig was built. Finite element analysis (FEA) results were obtained for different mesh types and different loading scenarios. FEA results obtained in this project were directly compared with 3D results of the same problem available in literature. Although the FEA results could not be accurately validated against the experimental results, the trends in both data sets were similar. The bone was modelled in 2D and as such significant assumptions were made regarding its structure. The cross-section selected was assumed to accurately represent the rest of the bone however it is clear that, in reality, a 2D cross-section cannot successfully represent complex 3D bone geometry.",

It was greatly popularised because of its controller which could track hand movements accurately without the need of a camera. But very little immersive games were developed due to the ideology that a hand movement was equivalent to a button press. This meant that developers just changed their programs from a button press to a hand gesture. Speed and accuracy was rarely accounted for. With this in mind a game was developed where the speed and accuracy of hand movements were necessary to win. A computerised version of table football (also known as “Foosball”) was developed with an interface for the user to use a nintendo wii remote. Hand position and movement are traced on screen in real time and players need to react to the motion of the ball within a limited time span. The user can select from several different difficulty levels which makes the computer opponent better skilled depending on the interest of the main users. This program deals with interfaces to connect the nintendo wii remote to the computer as well as a GUI. It was mainly developed in java with a lot of the ball physics being developed to mimic real world physics. Overall this program is great fun to try and caters for anyone who would like to be entertained for a while.",

Due to barriers such as high initial costs and the need to maintain existing networks which are still widely used and profitable for Telcos, LTE network rollouts have been slow in some areas of the world. Although rollout has been slow in some areas, LTE coverage is continuing to grow and is set to become the first truly global mobile network standard. Furthermore, the amount of data being sent across mobile networks is increasing. According to the Cisco VNI Mobile Data Traffic Forecast for 2013-2018, it is predicted that the global mobile data traffic usage per month will surpass 15 Exabytes, indicating a growth of 1000% in just 5 years. With a huge growth in mobile data usage predicted the following question is raised: in areas without LTE coverage how can R&D teams prototype and test applications and protocols to run over LTE networks? The purpose of this project is to provide a low cost and effective test methodology, namely a real time test bed which can interact with real IP based network traffic. This project extends the NS3 (Network Simulator 3) LENA module to interact with real-time IP based traffic. The environment created allows two computers to communicate with each other over a simulated LTE network in real-time. It was found that for small network configurations, the scenarios tested in real-time emulation performed just as well as scenarios tested in discrete-time simulation.

Coaches are reliant on absorbing the positioning and movement of a group of players and analysing in real time how they are acting as a unit. Furthermore they are reliant on memory to determine how individuals did within a game scenario. PlayerTracker builds-on present day technologies and enhances their use through the development of a player and team tracking system. Using GPS technology, real time data streaming and cloud in-memory processing, PlayerTracker can provide • Live positioning and team formation illustrations and performance on a tablet or other digital device. • Individual player match analyses including distance covered, average speed and a heat-map representation of positions adopted during the game. • Match data archived for later analyses. • Player development comparison against archived information. This will offer coaches an overview of team performance and dynamics including individual player metrics. Each player is tracked in relation to other players and the representation can be replayed and examined to identify strengths and weakness in a strategy or formation at any time in a game. The SAP-HANA in-memory process will be employed for data processing. It operate as the analytical processing engine for our proposed system and provides the perfect environment for analysing a constant stream of player information data and providing real-time reporting and playback functionality on digital devices. This application will provide to the mass market the technologies currently only available to sports scientists attached to elite organisations such as premiership football clubs or international sporting bodies.",

        "description": "There is a strong urgency for the world to increase its energy efficiency. Pumps currently consume approximately 10% of global energy [1]. This figure alone provided the required motivation for the completion of the project. Wastewater treatment facilities pump large volumes of fluids daily. Potentially, there is a big opportunity in this sector for energy savings. The focus of this report is the use of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in wastewater treatment systems. The main aims of the project are to assess the potential of VFDs to reduce pump energy consumption and to ascertain the challenges involved. Achieving the overall aims of the project required the completion of a number of steps. An extensive literature survey was carried out to develop an in-depth understanding of the pumping process characteristics; this involved researching how VFDs actually work within a wastewater treatment system to reduce energy consumption. From this, an analysis was carried out on an energy consumption calculator available online. The analysis provides details of how the tool calculates energy costs, while also recognising its limitations. Finally, the dead-leg rig in the thermofluids laboratory was upgraded with a new pump and VFD. A series of tests was carried out to assess the energy savings and benefits of using VFDs. The overall results of the experiment supported the data found when carrying out the literature review. The use of a VFD in the system to control flow significantly reduced power consumption and produced cost savings of 35% over the period of the test. It was found that, in relation to wastewater treatment facilities, it is important to calculate the benefits of a VFD on a case by case basis. This is due to system variables changing between different facilities. The results obtained in the project serve as an indication of the potential savings achievable through the installation of VFDs in wastewater treatment applications.",

The system is a software tool that will manage and conserve water usage in large non-domestic water users. The overall goal of the system is to reduce costs by lowering the gross water usage of an organisation by implementing a personalised automated system. This is done by managing and analysing all data received by water meters with emphasis placed on leak detection. We offer our customers a unique service by personalising the water management system to each organisation by means of consolidation. The system’s main user interface will be a mapped view of the organisations water schema in which each water meter will be highlighted and clickable. Our prototype is based on Dublin Airport Authority’s (DAA) water scheme. Currently the DAA does not have an automated system in place and water readings are taken manually every month. M&M Water Management System will take daily water readings sending the data automatically to the database. This will reduce manual labour as there will be no need to physically take readings. Taking meter readings daily as opposed to monthly will provide more accurate data for analysis, this will also be used to accurately bill commercial water users within the DAA. Most importantly daily readings will detect leaks far faster and in turn reduce the overall water usage, this means the worst case scenario a leak will go 24 hours unnoticed. Currently a leak could potentially go a month unnoticed until the next water reading.",

Method: The Hoka shoe was compared to suitable control. Running trials & drop jump trials were carried out using force plates and in shoe pressure sensors. These data sets were then synchronised and examined. Compression testing was also carried out on the shoe midsoles. This compression data was examined and also used to calculate parameters of the Ogden Compressible Foam model in Ansys. Results: Average vertical loading rate, response time & maximum active peak force were all found to have statistically significant differences. Drop test trials were discounted due to high inter-trial variability. Centre of pressure trajectories for both shoes showed some evidence of biomechanical changes of the foot and ankle. Compression data showed that the Hoka shoe was generally a stiffer shoe then the control. Conclusion: Evidence was found for kinetic changes and possible kinematic changes between the shoes. Results must be interpreted with caution however due to a small sample size. Further research with large sample is suggested.",

The main aim of the project is to create an online database to store and access penalty points accrued by drivers and other road users. The benefit to motorists is that their data can be easily accessed at any time through a single online or App-based portal. For example, motorists might access their account to view a summary of all of the penalty points that they have received, along with information such as the offence for which the points were awarded, the date the points were received, confirmation of payment of any fine and the date on which the points will expire. This could be helpful, for example, when applying for or renewing motor insurance. The initial target customer base is motorists in the Republic of Ireland, but there is potential to expand the application into other countries that employ some form of Penalty Points system. The web application also includes video tutorials which show how to use different aspects of the system to assist users in using and making the most of the capabilities of the system. The web application has been developed using Bootstrap framework, which ensures that the application can be viewed on smartphone devices. The motivation behind developing the application comes from frustrations encountered when using the current system for checking penalty points in Ireland. This cannot be done on a smartphone, nor is it available on the web, with the only way to access the information being by a voice phone call using a chargeable number. This new application will give everyone with access to a smartphone or web terminal the ability to check their penalty points at any time.",

The web service also communicates with Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in order to deliver the notification to the Android devices. The Linux shell application is written in Python. Once configured by the user it monitors set tasks or commands and relays the outcome of that task, along with system meta-data, to the web service. The third and final piece to SHout is the Android application.

This project aimed to produce a discrete event simulation (DES) model to analyse and improve the current performance of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), through reducing lead, transport and activity times within the system. Discrete event simulation is a step-wise refinement process used to analyse how real world activity will perform under different conditions. It allows testing of a system without the cost, monetarily and in terms of time, of actually physically adapting the system. Problems can be quickly approximated and solutions tested to improve knowledge of the system, as well as evaluate the potential impact any changes could make to the system. The simulation of the system for this project was developed using version 8 of ExtendSim’s modelling software. The current queue and activity times of the system were measured and inputted into the model, and the results analysed to discover any operational inefficiency and identify potential means of improving the system’s functionality.",

A review of powered surgical instruments was carried out. It was found that the use of ultrasonic power is commonly adopted by surgeons for cutting and ablation of tissues. The desired function is linked to the type of end effector. Electrosurgery (use of electrical energy) has also been applied in the medical field and there seem to be parallels between this method and the use of ultrasonic power. The application of these technologies in medicine motivates research for the refinement of these technologies. This focuses on reducing their disadvantages, which are essentially the effect of temperature and damage to areas surrounding the incision. High-energy, low frequency ultrasound was chosen for this project. The primary area was the design of a sonotrode for use with the Branson digital sonifier 450d. Finite element analysis was used to establish the working geometry of the probe. A probe consisting of a 40 degree tip angle was manufactured from grade 2 titanium. It was tested and results compared against a probe 70 degree tip angle. A porcine heart was used in testing. Rubber samples were tested as a control measure. Testing would examine the effect of tip angle on the cutting rate for tissue, with the different densities of tissues accounted for. These tests were conducted first with ultrasound and also without ultrasound. Results showed an increased cutting rate for a sharp probe when the tip was vibrating ultrasonically compared to unassisted cutting, for tissues of higher yield strength. A device with a sharp probe tip may be sufficient for cutting softer tissues requiring little or no ultrasonic power, unless ablation is the intended action. Thermal damage was observed for all ultrasound assisted experiments due to the elevation of probe temperature. The control of force in ultrasound assisted devices is attributed to surgical expertise, playing a role in the physical post-surgical results and healing process.",

It also looks at the administration of the league through bettering communication between league officials and the teams. Each user has a profile page where he/she can update their contact information also and referees have the ability to submit cards through the application by associating a card with a player and entering in scores of matches which in turn will automatically update the league table. The application is split into two user interfaces. The first GUI is web based, where a user can log in on a browser to use the application. The second option which a user can use is a mobile application which will be available on iPhone/Android devices. The mobile application will also be used to send and receive league alerts for fixtures and other team related issues and also for referees to update the league table by submitting scores at the end of the game. ‘SportsHub’ user interface design is kept as simple as possible for the user.

The immunoassay well plates currently being used contain well sizes down in the lower Œºm which is the benchmark to aim for. The CO2 laser without optimisation would produce well sizes too large and not of a high enough quality to be considered adequate for use as immunoassay plates. In order to optimise the CO2 laser for the manufacturing of these plates a Design of Experiments approach was taken After a screening experiment alumina ceramic was found to produce less burring, staining and a cleaner smaller well than other tested materials. To determine the quality of the well/hole produced, quality was defined as a combination of hole diameter, circularity, HAZ (Heat Affected Zone) and hole taper, and importantly the reliability and confidence interval associated with each experimental run. Design of Experiments approach overcame the problem of accurately determining the optimum set of parameters, shown by means of numerical and graphical results. The smallest produced hole was 159.1 Œºm and was found on the entrance side of the slide. However the optimal run was determined using a power setting of 20W, focal point position of -4000 Œºm below the surface and an assist gas pressure of 1Bar.The smallest hole produced was 176.2 Œºm in this combination of parameters. Importantly this set of parameters had by far the best confidence interval with a 95% CI of 1.46 Œºm rendering it optimal. Circularity was 0.93, and had a HAZ thickness of 8.59 Œºm. The taper was 1.34°. The biggest influence on hole diameter, and taper was power. Focal point position influenced circularity and hole diameter significantly.

        "description": "This project involved conducting work in two thermal spraying facilities in DCU. A plasma spray facility which was of operational status but required the implementation of equipment and issues to be resolved with current equipment in order to improve the process. A high velocity oxy-fuelled (HVOF) spray facility which is in a state of decommission and required work to prepare the facility for operation once again, while also improving the health and safety standard. The tasks completed in both facilities focused on four areas; health and safety, process improvement, problem solving and issue resolution, and facility commissioning. The scope and objective of this project differed from that of a traditional final year project; accounting for this fact it was approach in a different way more like a project would be typically in industry, employing the ethos of a project engineer and adopting project management tools. The project was dissected into four stages: initiating, planning, performing, and closing. The performing stage accounted for the highest effort and time. The work was identified as tasks and similar tasks were grouped into work packages. There were 8 work packages accounting for 29 individual tasks in total. The plasma spray facility was successfully fitted with the traverse unit and all corresponding hardware was integrated. A test substrate mounting system was designed, manufactured, and implemented also. The substrate clamp incorporated an element of adjustment for standoff (distance from gun to substrate) which had previously not been available. Significant progression was made in the recommissioning of the HVOF facility. The traverse unit was successfully mounted with a new gun mounting system. The new mounting system was required to house both HVOF guns simultaneously and was designed and manufactured as an element of this project. Assortments of health and safety improvements were successfully implemented on equipment and hardware in the facility.",

Without fresh water of adequate quality and quantity, sustainable development would not be possible[1]. Microfluidic chip and support technologies offer countless opportunities to those that utilise them[2] providing an excellent platform for water quality monitoring. This project required the development of a disposable microfluidic chip (MC) with an integrated chemical reagent that would be used for analytical applications of water quality monitoring in water bodies such as swimming pools, rivers, lakes and water treatment facilities. The project commenced with an initial study of microfluidics and microfluidic chips. This was followed by the design and manufacture of a set of novel chips. Subsequent to this, testing involving the HACH power pillow chemical reagents for nitrite NO^ took place. Initially the reagents were tested using a UV spectrometer to determine the type of photodiode required in conjunction with a light emitting diode (LED) for testing on the chip and the reagents ability to be used at small volumes. A sensor holder was designed and manufactured. Finally, experimentation took place on a clamped chip with the powder reagent inside, focusing on phosphate testing with a brief look at nitrite. It was found that while the photodiode detector was not capable to distinguish between concentrations in a consistent manner. To conclude, further work and research is required on the use of HACH power pillow chemical reagents for phosphate and nitrite testing before they can be used as viable integrated reagents on Microfluidic Chips.

Typically, desktop software packages used to perform these analyses are very cumbersome and expensive. A lighter, portable version for mobile devices would be very useful to the modern engineer. The goal of this project was to build upon an existing program so that in addition to the 2D truss elements already available, 2D constant strain triangle elements could be used to model engineering systems. There is a distinct lack of effective, easy to use 2D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) apps for mobile devices. There are currently Smartphone apps which use truss and beam elements in their models, however these are unable to model complex solids. The addition of constant strain triangle elements facilitates the user to model two dimensional stress and strain problems such as a plate with a hole in it. An investigation into the formulation of constant strain triangle finite elements was undertaken and its fundamental equations were adapted and used to create an FEA Smartphone app. The app was extensively tested to ensure its consistent and reliable operation. The app performed just as well as a desktop FEA package when tested and the results obtained correlated with results found in literature. Upon examination of the fundamental equations of the constant strain triangle element it was found that as the shape of the element deviated from an equilateral triangle, it became increasingly unreliable at accurately predicting stress/strain behaviour. It followed that in order to maintain an acceptable level of accuracy a significant number of elements needed to be employed in the model.",

The application display resembles that of radar display used in air traffic control towers. Within a set range, the ‘radar’ displays airplane positions relative to the device for aircraft that are transmitting. Test cases have been performed and the results have been examined to check the soundness of the application. Issues related to the installation of this application in a light aircraft are explored with regard to safety and economics.

        "description": "Cold spraying is a thermal spray process that applies a protective coating on the surface of materials. The material which the coating is applied to is known as a substrate. The coating material is accelerated to supersonic velocities onto the surface of the substrate in particle form using a converging-diverging nozzle. The kinetic energy of the coating powder is converted to plastic deformation energy upon impact with the substrate, forming a bond between the coating powder and the surface. Cold spraying operates at relatively low temperatures (650°C and below) compared to other thermal spray techniques. The coating material is in a solid state when adhesion occurs with the substrate. The cold spray process produces a coating that is dense, less porous, stronger adhesion, reduced oxidation, and reduced residual stress. The aim of this project was to design and develop a low temperature deposition nozzle that could be attached to a heat gun to perform the cold spay process. This results in a cold spray process that’s low-cost, practical, and portable. The nozzle was designed using fluid dynamic principles and through the research and analysis of previous experiments. It was developed further using Computational Fluid Dynamic software and through physical data gathered from experimentation. When the final design was decided upon the nozzle was manufactured in the DCU workshop. It was then tested in the DCU thermal spraying room. A successful coating was not applied due to the high pressure in the converging side of the nozzle preventing the coating material from entering the nozzle. Further analysis of the process resulted in a number of possible solutions. One of the solutions include injecting the particles into the diverging side of the nozzle which is an area of low pressure. There was no opportunity to implement these solutions for this particular project but this is something which could be developed further in the future.",

These techniques are widely used in image processing where they have applications in medical and scientific imaging. They are also used in seismology, most notably for oil exploration where system identification is required. The project contains a literature review of a selection of real life applications of these algorithms. The application of these methods is generally an ill-posed problem because all the information we need is unlikely to be known. There will also usually be some unknown noise component related to the signal. Therefore the focus should be less on finding exact solutions and more on finding estimation algorithms capable of producing acceptable solutions for these problems. In many cases little or none of the required information will be known. In these situations, human judgement is needed to make certain assumptions of the signal or system in question. The discussion will focus on Weiner filtering, the least squares deconvolution algorithm and Kalman filtering and a mathematical overview given. The aforementioned methods of deconvolution will also be implemented in Matlab for 1-D and 2-D problems. A degraded audio signal is chosen as a 1-D example and a blurred image is used to implement a 2-D example. The robustness of these techniques is tested under different conditions and a comparison on their speed, robustness to noise, efficiency and effectiveness is made.",

This project describes the development and design of an automated solution to increase efficiency on the high security steel door assembly line within Iron Images Ltd. The aims were to analyse current production processes and identify if there were any outdated production methods that through the use of new technologies could allow Iron Images to become more cost efficient and competitive as they further expand to European markets. This project was also intended to educate Iron Images as to how investment in production technologies can greatly benefit them in all of their future ventures by increasing their volumetric output and reducing manufacture costs. The project presents finalised designs and costing of an automated linear welder for implementation with the steel door assembly line. Designed as a low cost solution with minimalistic initial capital for an introduction to autonomous manufacture within Iron Images, the welder after implementation will reduce the manufacture costs by 2%.",

From this there has been a growing community of experts and DIY enthusiasts who share their methods in building a homebuilt wind turbine. Often amongst these designs, the Hugh Piggott fixed blade approach is adopted. Even though the Hugh Piggott design may be used by many owners of a homebuilt wind turbine, it is not clear if this is the most economical or efficient approach when harvesting the wind. In this project, the common industrial approach of using a variable pitch hub to allow the change in the pitching angle of the blade will be looked at. A detailed design solution will be presented, and the theoretical analyse of the performance of the new concept will be completed, using a free available software package, Qblade. The blades from the Hugh Piggott design will be integrated into the final design of the hub and a comparison between the variable pitch design and the original Hugh Piggott was made. The software package used in this project produced crucial parameters to allow the performance of both designs to be assessed and a comparison to be made between the new variable pitch design and the original Hugh Piggott solution. From this, the results that were produced show how certain aspects of both designs have there benefits, but for small wind turbine owners, the variable pitch hub design that was looked at in this project was not justified.",

The project would use performance metrics as a visual measure of performance, which in conjunction with lean tools and methodologies would be used to identify and eliminate waste within the system while measuring the level of improvement achieved. This project began by researching different Lean Six-Sigma tools and methodologies which could be used. The Six-Sigma DMAIC project methodology was chosen as it was identified as having the quality’s necessary to satisfy the project requirements. OEE was chosen as the performance metric to be used due to its ability to visually indicate the level of improvement made through improvement efforts as well as allowing the company to benchmark its manufacturing performance against other sites worldwide. In conjunction with the OEE data, Lean tools such as Root Cause Analysis, Pareto analysis and control charts were used to systematically identify and remove the main critical faults within the process. Once the limiting constraints were removed the process was run and new performance measures taken to test whether or not the improvement efforts had been successful. When verification was received confirming some level of improvement, control procedures were put in place to ensure improvements were not forgotten and reverted back to old methods. In conclusion the efforts of this project successfully achieved the deliverables and resulted in a reduction of machine downtime while reducing the inherent levels of variation present within the process. This reduction in machine downtime results in a better utilisation of equipment by reducing machining time required to manufacture a batch of product and, therefore, reducing the total cost of production. Through the efforts of this project OEE experienced a total increase of 7%, reducing operating costs by approximately $50k per annum. The reduction in process variability allows the company to create more accurate production schedules, reduce the amount of over time required to process batches that overrun the scheduled duration and ensure customer deadlines are consistently achieved.",

It is versatile indoor and outdoor high tip dumper, capable of carrying a payload of up to one tonne. Using the SolidWorks Simulation software program an analysis of the existing lifting mechanism design was undertaken. The Simulation Solver is a finite element method solver, used by engineers to predict and test the capabilities of a product without the need for a prototype. After an initial FEA study was completed the configuration of the design and the material dimensions were optimised to ensure the safe working conditions of the vehicle and the user. Optimising the design required modifications to the original concept improving the areas which the Simulation study indicated as weak points, or where failure occurred. After the optimal design was developed a final FEA study was carried out for all working positions of the mechanism through the lift cycle. The outcome of this final analysis proved the design modifications improved the strength, resisted deformation and improved the overall safety of the mechanism. The knowledge built up over the course of the project, was finally used to create an instruction manual on how to use the SolidWorks Simulation program. It provided a step by step guide to the setup, processing and the post processing of the software program; which could be used for future work or where no previous knowledge of Simulation was had.",

This game mimics the features and graphics of the original Age of Empires game, implemented through Objective-C with no original code re-use. The interface has been optimised to allow fluid interaction on mobile. I believe most games created for mobile platforms are still quite lighthearted and lightweight, intended for 10-15 gameplay at a time; when mobile games are compared to their equivalent console based games, a fairly obvious divide is clear. I believe the reason for this is primarily to do with interface. Touch screen interfaces are not suitable to most popular game types such as First Person Shooters, which require flexibility and fine detailed control. However the current generation of phones contain processors and memory far exceeding their current usage. I feel that other popular game types have a home on mobile. These game types include Real Time Strategy games. I intend to justify the mobile platform as a home for high end games; I believe interface is the big barrier and my port of AOE displays that a strong interface can make previously inaccessible markets accessible.

        "description": "This report presents a combinatorial optimisation algorithm that has the purpose of minimising the number of Mizusumashi that continuously replenish production lines in a manufacturing facility. The implementation of this algorithm will enable the management of workers or even a fleet of vehicles to determine if too many are currently being used to carry out the task. Employers are consistently looking for new ways to save money and reduce their costs. A frequently encountered problem in the workplace is excess staff working on a particular task. The algorithm presented in this study promises to decrease the costs for organisations in which it is implemented as it selects the optimum route which should be taken thus reducing the overall time. Previous studies offer descriptive accounts of vehicle content and route optimisation problems individually; however studies with the two combined were practically non-existent. The literature review addresses the algorithms which were examined and implemented. Initially these algorithms were looked at individually, however through advancements in the coding the two types of optimisation could be combined. Throughout the development of the algorithm constraints had to be considered. In relation to content optimisation, dimensional constraints of the products were in place to determine the number of items that could fit within the logistics cart, providing its capacity was not exceeded. For the route optimisation aspect of the algorithm a constraint was implemented to ensure that the replenishment is carried out within the two hour time frame of the milk-run. The efficiency of the algorithm was tested on a number of theoretical layouts presented in the report; interlocking doors and clean rooms were added to increase the problem’s complexity. Overall this Final Year Project presents the results which are the first stepping stone towards the proper development and implementation of this program in an industrial related field. A descriptive model and breakdown on how the results were obtained enables further research and development to be carried out. The project concludes with some recommendations for future development.",

The idea is to be able to offer a better range of discounts to students through participating partner stores and businesses while streamlining the overall process into a more modern, technological fashion. The web application, developed on the Play! framework with HTML5/Twitter Bootstrap 3, serves as the power house behind the whole project. The user creates an account online to use the service and to gain access to the app. Only verified students can register and this is ensured by requiring a sign-in through your college portal. Once registered, the user can log into the mobile app and begin availing of discounts in participating stores. Discounts are claimed using a digit code/QR-scan feature. The project itself is a proof of concept currently and has plenty of room for additional features. In an ideal world, this project would benefit from the use of RFID/NFC technology to allow ‘quick swipe’ discounting. Please drop by on the day to see the project demo in action.

One of the main areas we can see the use of optical communications is in the the roll out in the last decade of high speed fibre broadband. The high speeds associated with broadband systems are made possible by the use of optical fibre communication channels. One of the aspects of using optical fibre signals that must be considered is the attenuation of the signal in the fibre. Signal amplifiers are used to boost the signal in the fibre at intervals along the network. Most signal amplifiers convert the signal to an electrical signal before boosting the signal. One of the advantages of the SOA is that it boosts the optical signal without the need for conversion. The main disadvantage of the SOA is that the output power saturation point, the point below which is inappropriate for signal amplification, is quite low in comparison to other signal amplifiers. This project is an investigation into certain parameters to produce an optimum high saturation output power. The main concept relies on control of the carrier density within a multi-contact SOA and predicting the best solution using a number of methods including using the genetic algorithm to help produce the best results.",

        "description": "Often when an event is being held in a large area, be it for entertainment, social, sporting, political or business reasons, many people visit locations for the first time and don’t know how to get there or find their way around the event. They have very little knowledge of the surroundings, nearby facilities, and most importantly in the case of festivals and business conferences, where all the important places of interest are located. This can often leave people late, frustrated, and racing around asking for directions. With modern technology this is completely avoidable. Our application, is a location aware smart phone event app that will utilise Google Maps technology, and provide the user with a dedicated map of a specified event location. The app will display an array of entities that the user can then select to view details about, and furthermore the user can map a route from their current location to the chosen entity. The app also provides different functionality, which will aid the user at a given event. The ‘Take Me Back’ feature allows the user to save their current locations and return to them at a later time by tracking the saved location via GPS. This will save the user both time and effort and will allow them to quickly retrace their steps. An example is finding your tent at a festival like Electric Picnic, or finding your car after the festival has ended. This handy app will undoubtedly improve your event experience and provide you with the simple tools necessary to find your way around with ease, get information about the surrounding area, and retrace your steps in one service. The most impressive functionality of our app is the capability of users to create a group of friends who also have the app. Users can then locate each other via the app which accurately pinpoints friends locations on a map. This feature is likely to be very popular, especially at very crowded events such as concerts and festivals where people tend to get separated from each other for large periods of time. It can also be looked at as a security feature.",

Polymer/ceramic composites have great potential as bone interface materials for low loading applications. The introduction of ceramic into a polymer matrix has been found to increase the Young’s Modulus to within the lower ranges of cortical bone. A widely used ceramic for this application is hydroxyapatite (HA), which bears a close resemblance to the calcium phosphate phase of bone and as a result has excellent bioactivity and biocompatibility properties. A suitable simplified manufacturing route had to be deployed to produce composites of suitable quality. The composite itself consisted of polypropylene (PP) and HA at a ratio of 80% and 20% respectively. This process involved dry mixing the two materials before feeding them into an injection moulder. The effects of changing the manufacturing route and process parameters were investigated. Initial attempts produced a composite of inconsistent quality, exhibiting an unusual and unfavourable response to loading. Recycling of initial mouldings was found to produce composites with a significantly and consistently increased value for Young’s Modulus, to the order achieved in reviewed works. Varying the processing temperature was found to have mixed results. Composites manufactured at a temperature of 200°C were found to have little or no increase in Young’s Modulus. This report contains detailed analysis of the stress/strain behaviour, fracture surfaces, and compositional makeup of the tested composites and also recommendations for future development of this work.",

One of the factors that can determine the value of a record, is how badly scratched the record is. The aim of this project is to use image processing and analysis techniques to develop a system, which automatically detects scratches present on the record and classifies the degree of scratching on the surface of a vinyl record.

This Application will allow users to make their business more profitable and more efficient as global demand for food continues to increase. Our application will allow users to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. In the Irish Agricultural Industry today, the majority of information is stored on spreadsheets and paper based systems. These record keeping systems can be hard to manage and can be difficult to leverage in order to gain competitive advantage within the market. Our application aims to bring all of this information into one centralised location to be readily accessed by the user at anytime from anywhere. The main reason we chose this project is that we believe that all farms should be brought into the modern technological age. Machinery has become more technological and has improved efficiency greatly. However the same strides have not been made in farm management. We believe that there is a huge gap in the market for our product as farmers wish to increase profitability and efficiency in an age where the cost of running farms is increasing. The agriculture industry accounts for over 36% of the global workforce but there is a lack of useful software tailored towards farmers. Complete Farm Management aims to introduce this software to farmers. It will allow farmers to map out their own farm on interactive maps. It will allow them to record and manage significant information about their fields including crops, nitrates, fertiliser, spraying dates, under sow and yield.

The key driver for this research was a 2004 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report concerning heavy metal pollution in the Silvermines region of County Tipperary. The EPA report recommended an automated approach to pollution testing to replace conventional methods which had a number of disadvantages, for example, the length of time required to process results and the potential exposure of the tester to harmful heavy metals and other toxic substances. This project builds on previous work undertaken in CLARITY. The aim of this project was to further develop an existing rig for autonomous, in-situ testing for airborne heavy metals. The rig incorporates an X-ray Fluorescent (XRF) analyser that detects substances at the elemental level. Interested stakeholders potentially include environmental monitoring agencies. The project involved a number of important mechanical and electronic engineering developments. An Arduino Microcontroller was introduced to control the system, thus making it easier for people to use and adapt. The system includes two stepper motors and the circuitry was adapted for easier power management. The project also involved the design and fabrication of a container for holding the tested samples, thus improving traceability. Initial testing was undertaken to determine the feasibility of pumping the particulate onto the filter paper for testing. In order to do this, separate testing was required to determine the optimal thickness of the sampled airborne particles. The report presents the system developments to date and the results of the preliminary XRF testing.",

The aims of this project were to manufacture and determine the mechanical properties, setting time, adhesive strength and injectability of a novel hydrogel. This novel hydrogel, called EnduraGel, was developed in DCU. Compression testing and tensile testing were carried out to determine the novel hydrogels mechanical properties. As the novel hydrogel will be injected into the cerebral aneurysm through a catheter the setting time and injectability had to be determined. A component and experiment were designed to find the time the novel hydrogel sets at room temperature and at 37°C, which is body temperature.

As such control theory and systems theory seeks to combine the analysis of these fields under one umbrella. This project details the development of an educational platform for use in teaching control theory and systems analysis. The centrepiece of this design is a physical apparatus which is controlled by a micro-controller and is capable of interfacing with MATLAB. This project illustrates the early conceptual phases of the design of the physical apparatus all the way through to the final implementation of the finished system. For the final implementation of the apparatus a stepper motor was used as the main actuator. Optical position sensors were also used to form a system feedback loop. The Arduino prototyping embedded systems platform was used to provide I/O capabilities for these actuators and sensors. In this project, a phase lead compensation approach was adopted to implement the position control of the ball on the physical beam. Simulation studies give encouraging results regarding the applicability of the developed controller design whilst the documented experimental results highlight the constraints and limitations of the approach with respect to the actual physical rig.",

The mobile app allows the user to create two teams and configure game rules such as game length & number of players. The application can optionally allow for location and weather data to be recorded, but this is not critical to the project functionality. During a Gaelic game, the system allows game score and game time recording for basic game statistics. Players can be created and edited to match real-world data (E.g. player name & position) and players can be substituted when required. The user can optionally record various in game events and the consequence of that event (E.g. booking, score, wide). Each event is assigned to a specific player to allow for fine grained statistics and player accountability. The above functionality can be recorded for both home and away teams so detailed data can be gathered. The data recording is achieved through a “game-view” user interface. A sample of possible game events are as follows: • Fouls: Free/Penalty • Shot: Free/Penalty/45/Side-line/Play • Kick-outs • Turnovers Statistics can be generated from recorded game data. These statistics can be in displayed in both textual and graphical formats and allow the user to compare specific events against the opposing team. A time log of events is also be available to the user. The statistics are presented in a simplistic and intuitive manner to clearly show strengths, weaknesses and/or correlations throughout the match. This allows a consumer to deduce informed decisions to aid and/or remedy any areas of concern highlighted by the statistics.

This project is an android adaptation of Gomoku where the user can play online or against an AI. The problem with Gomoku is that it produces a large search tree and exhaustive searching would be impractical.

The Deals Companion application will have a cloud database system that will communicate with the businesses database system where offers will be updated and synchronised to the cloud database and then with the application. The Deals Companion application will automatically find a user’s location using GPS or alternatively the user can manually enter in their location. Based on the user’s location, the Deals Companion application will suggest deals that are currently on offer by many local businesses within a specified radius of the user. Once the user selects a deal to purchase, they have a number of options available to them, they can select ‘Pay in-store’ and the item will be reserved in-store for a specified time, they can also pay for the item directly through the Deals Companion application and collect the item from the retailer or opt for ‘Pay & Post’ the availability of this option is dependent on the retailers providing this service. The Deals Companion application was developed in response to the need for users to be able to view local deals on the go and collect that day. The main online sales application companies only offer postage which means users can be waiting up to ten working days for their item. Our application allows user to collect the item in-store or have it reserved in-store for a specified time as well as posted. The Deals Companion application is currently a proof of concept project. Based on our market research we feel this project has the potential to excel, and we would like to see it developed in the future.",

Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energies that can lead to a clean environment, less money spent on utilities and a healthier world. Solar cells which convert the sun’s energy into electricity are costly and inefficient. Different mechanisms have been applied to increase the efficiency of those cells to maximise the output energy. A solar tracker system is the most appropriate technology to enhance the efficiency of solar cells by tracking the sunlight throughout the day, thereby ensuring the greatest possible incidence angle of the sunlight onto the cells. This project presents the design and fabrication of a low cost microcontroller-based solar tracker. Light dependent resistors are used as the sensors for the solar tracker and the designed tracker will provide two degrees of freedom for movement.",

Due to the time limitations on the project a two specific objectives were identified: the app should allow the user to draw basic geometric entities (line, circle, rectangle) and the app should be capable of importing drawings from other CAD software using the DXF graphics exchange format. Initial work consisted on learning to program using Java and, subsequently, learning the specifics of programming the Android System. As this project will be further developed by final year students in coming years, it was important that the code was developed in such a way that it is easily understandable and easily adapted. The Android user interface (UI) was designed to initially show two options: create a drawing or import a drawing. Touching either of these options on the Android device brings the user to an appropriate screen. The create screen provides methods for entering the coordinates of the three primitive types (line, circles, rectangles) and provides a canvas on which the resultant drawing is automatically displayed. The import screen opens a file picker which allows the user to point a DXF file containing a CAD model. The import facility currently finds the first line in the CAD model, determines its start and end coordinates, transitions to the create UI and displays the line on the canvas. In conclusion, a simple demonstration CAD smartphone app has been developed. Although the functionality of the app is currently quite limited the code is capable of being readily expanded to introduce additional functionality by subsequent final year project students.",

The equipment that have been analysed include a double pipe heat exchanger, an air and water heat pump, a refrigeration unit and an air conditioning unit. The aim of the project was to compare the energy and exergy balance approaches and to determine whether an exergy analysis was necessary for thermal systems. Due to the effects of global warming becoming more apparent, the need for efficient use of natural energies is clear. The combined use of energy and exergy analysis is a key thermodynamic theory which can determine the complete performance of a process. An exergy balance defines the level of energy degradation in a system as well as its ability to do work. On completion of the analyses it was found that the use of both an exergy and energy balance can help determine a system’s ideal operating conditions. The advantage of an exergy balance becomes clear when each component in a system is analysed. An exergy analysis locates areas that account for high a percentage of the exergy destruction and inefficiencies in a system. By determining the coefficient of performance and the exergy destruction in each system the ideal operating conditions can be determined. For the heat pump, refrigeration unit and air conditioner it was found that the condenser accounts for a significant amount the of the exergy destruction in each system, while other critical components such as the evaporator, compressor and expansion valve have less of on an overall effect on the total performance. However, an improvement in their efficiencies will still have a positive effect on the overall performance.",

This is highly important as fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem affecting organisations in every industry across the globe. The development of the project followed a four step process: i) Tool selection, ii) Key Performance Indicator (KPI) selection, iii) Building the initial and final design, and iv) Testing within Accenture. These processes involved working closely with Accenture personnel to gain an understanding of the organisation’s needs and methods. • The tool selection aspect involved rigorous assessment of current reporting/Business Intelligence tools on the market in order to develop the report on the most appropriate platform • The selection of KPI’s proved to be the cornerstone of the project. This involved using various techniques to select and assess metrics as well as taking the company’s policies and requirements into account • The building of the report was completed in Excel as this proved the most suitable. A high level of functionality and design were achieved through utilising Excel’s built in pivot tools and adopting Accenture design styles • The testing was conducted within Accenture as industry experts with years of fraud experience were included in this phase. Feedback was very positive The completion of this project resulted in a highly visual, intuitive, and integrated fraud and noncompliance reporting suite. Future work will continue within Accenture to deploy the report across various analytics projects/client workshops allowing Accenture to quickly implement a means to demonstrate fraud analytics capabilities to c-suite clients.",

This can be seen in almost all of today’s films, whereby the camera may follow a subject as they walk, rotate around them to emphasise their presence or zoom in on an object to reveal its detail. In many cases in the film industry, these are manually operated as a very fine degree of accuracy is not needed but this project creates a motorised camera dolly that cannot only complete tracking shots but take still frames for Image Processing and Analysis. Therefore its movements must be accurate and quantifiable. The dolly designed and fabricated in this project can pan a DSLR camera across the 1 metre fixed track while simultaneously rotating it with a high degree of accuracy. To achieve this accuracy, stepper motors are used to operate both the pan and rotate functions. It also means the movements can be quantified without feedback by the steps of the motor. The entire system is controlled by the Beagle Bone which is powered by an ARM microprocessor. This is a very powerful embedded system that has a large number of input/output pins which means there is room for future projects to add extra functionality if so required. Connection to the Beagle Bone is via secure shell (ssh) and this is how the device is controlled over the internet. The device runs Linux Ubuntu and the project is coded in C/C++.

Due to the ever increasing demand for the use of renewable sources of energy to reduce the world’s reliance on fossil fuels coupled with current EU directives on renewable energy targets this project deals with reducing greenhouse gas emissions along with providing a cheap alternative to existing energy sources. Using the top waste trending products produced at the bakery facility a mechanical pre-treatment is used to prepare samples for elemental analysis and experimental analysis using a Costech element analyser and a series of anaerobic reactors respectively to examine biogas yield. Due to inhibition of methane production from acidic conditions within the reactor, the results from this experiment are not fully conclusive yet do show signs of biofuel production. With methane yields of 0.0550 - 0.3966 L/g[VS] from an expected 0.5413 - 0.5813 L/g[VS] and an ethanol concentration of 0.82 - 1.32% it is quite clear that biofuels are being produced, albeit not in volumes great enough to provide a viable source of energy.",

This project aims to improve the existing anodising equipment and process and to tackle the corrosion resistance of anodised aluminium suggesting solutions and widening its application areas. During the course of this project, equipment was designed and manufactured for the anodising tank in order to obtain a stable process producing the required coating on all samples. Experiments were conducted in order to find the best anodising process with least changing variables using the new experimental equipment. Following to this set of experiments, the best processes were chosen to be repeated in order to its reproducibility. After an evaluation of the obtained samples, a decision has been made about the specific parameters of the anodising tank resulting in the best and most reproducible anodic oxide layer quality. In an attempt to improve corrosion resistance of anodised aluminium, some alterations have been made for the sealing phase involved in the anodising process. The resultant samples have been tested against corrosion inside a dishwasher. Using the hydrothermal sealing method, a sealing time of 45 minutes has been found having best corrosion resistance.

CloudFUSE uses the FUSE library in order to create a fully functional filesystem that gets synchronised with a remote storage provider like Dropbox. FUSE module provides a “bridge” to the actual kernel interfaces. It acts as an abstraction layer between non-privileged user code and the kernel itself which allows the filesystem to reside in user space. Dropbox gives us initially 2 GB of storage space. A cool idea would be to access that space just like a local hard drive partition. This is the core idea behind CloudFUSE. It is used to replicate cloud storage data and keep files in sync. Dropbox space can be mounted as a local file system even on hardware that isn’t supported by the storage provider’s sync agent/desktop app. CloudFUSE has been developed with programmers in mind. Often desktop/mobile storage apps synchronise everything in a particular folder, however this is often unnecessary for a programmer as binary files, for instance, are easily generated by compiling the source code again. This project makes it simple to ignore such “restricted” files. CloudFUSE supports file permissions for synchronised and locally stored files. After the filesystem is mounted it reflects the current access rights for each file. For efficiency the system keeps in memory the most recent snapshot of the listed files’ metadata and updates it after a specified interval of time.",

It is a major problem for shipping, as biofouling on a ship’s hull can reduce its speed and increase its fuel consumption. Toxic coatings and biocides have been used to prevent fouling, but these coatings can have hugely negative impacts on the marine environment. This project aims to develop an environmentally friendly alternative to biocides using surface topographies. The topographies designed in this study consist of randomly placed micro-pillars across a 2D plane, 1 centimetre square in size. The density of the pillars in each centimetre square varies from 1000 to 10000 pillars. The initial design concepts were created in SolidWorks. From here the design files were adapted for use with a Heidelberg maskless lithographer in order to create a photomask. This mask was subsequently used to create a silicon master using the process of photolithography. This master is used as the final mould on which the PDMS test surfaces were cast. In order to determine the anti-fouling effectiveness of the surfaces, each sample was exposed to the diatom, Amphora Coffeaeformis. The test topographies were then imaged using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in order to establish what, if any, anti-fouling properties the test surface may have. The initial findings were inconclusive; diatom settlement was observed; both in close proximity to the pillars and on the flat control surfaces on the PDMS casting. Although the initial results didn’t suggest that the pillars affected the settlement of the diatoms, further work testing much larger pillar densities may prove a more viable deterrent. A second design concept is also outlined in the report that focuses around the patterning of pits with varying shapes instead of pillars. This surface design may prove more fruitful in identifying anti-fouling properties for surface micro-topographies.",

        "description": "Metal fracture fixation plates and screws are regularly employed to assist bone fracture healing in orthopaedic surgery. Non-union is a common issue which affects up to 25% of patients treated with fracture fixation plates. This issue often arises as a result of too much or too little movement occurring at the fracture site. It is now known that the level of relative displacement, known as interfragmentary strain (IFS), is the most important factor in determining if fracture healing will be successful. This project aims to reduce the risk of non-union by determining the effect of adjusting a number of fixation parameters on the resulting interfragmentary strain. Results were obtained using finite element software to analyse a model created of the human femur. The model was first validated using results obtained experimentally in existing literature. Rigorous testing was then carried out using different screw configurations, plate thicknesses, fracture gap sizes and bone-plate distances in order to determine what parameters have the greatest effect on strain. Results found that the choice of screw configuration had the greatest effect on the levels of strain experienced at the fracture site. Interesting trends were also noted about which screw combinations had the greatest and least influence on strain levels. The effect of raising the plate above the surface was also shown to have a noticeable effect on results obtained. It is hoped that the conclusions drawn from this study could aid surgeons in choosing appropriate fixation devices and techniques in each patient specific case.",

        "description": "WizardVR is a virtual reality proof of concept demonstrator, made in the Unity game engine. It utilises new hardware, the Oculus Rift & Razer Hydras, to create a responsive and immersive game world in which you can live out your fantasy of being a wizard. The demonstrator boasts multiple spells, each with its own unique feature, such as shooting light to illuminate a dark passageway, or using levitation to pick up objects. The world is made more immersive by using the second Razer Hydra to track your body’s position, allowing you to peak around corners and crouch behind walls. This project’s goal is to investigate the re-emerging technology that is virtual reality, and how to further the sense of immersion in a virtual world. Virtual Reality has made headlines in the past year due to the Oculus Rift, which has received high praise from the greatest minds in the industry, and has caused a number of competitors to start work on their own virtual reality devices, most notably, Sony. Virtual Reality has been around for a long time, but with the rapid development in the technology available, it will finally become a more fully realised aspect of the modern entertainment experience.",

        "description": "Heat loss through the envelope of a building via the building fabric is a major source of heat energy waste. This energy waste has a negative impact on both the environment and occupants of the building. If there are large amounts of heat loss from a house it will make the living conditions very uncomfortable and this will require the heating to remain on for excessive periods. There are ways of reducing the amount of heat that is lost from a building, and in this report a house which has recently undergone a comprehensive insulation programme is studied. The aims of this project are to ensure that the insulation has been installed to the appropriate standard, determine the heat loss from the newly insulated building enveloped, calculate the payback period for the programme and assess thermography as a potential inspection method. The heat transfer was calculated using two approaches, the first was the Incidence Factor method, and the second was the Dwelling Energy Assessment Procedure used in the Building Energy Rating methodology. The results for the corrected U-Value of the building envelope were 151.7394 W/K and 150.7394 W/K for the Incidence Factor method and the DEAP method respectively. The payback period was calculated to be 38.4 years, but this result is not entirely accurate as it does not account for the effects of air infiltration and exfiltration. It was also found that there were some areas in the building where the insulation had not been installed correctly. To conclude there is a gap in the market for the use of thermography in the inspection of buildings. Further work is required, in order to standardise the inspection procedure with thermography and the methodology used to calculate the heat transfer through a surface before it can be integrated into the Building Energy Rating approach.",

        "description": "Heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent cause of death worldwide with as many as 10,000 people dying each year in Ireland alone because of heart failure. Many of these cases are the result of failure of the heart valves due to both acquired and congenital valvular heart disease. In cases where valve function has been severely impaired, the replacement of the valve(s) in question is the only viable solution. There is currently a vast choice of prosthesis available on the market with both biological and mechanical prosthetics being regularly implanted. The objective of the project is to compare the fluid dynamic performance of mechanical heart valves using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The project outlines the advantages of choosing mechanical heart valves over bio-prosthesis and details the hemodynamic characteristics of three types of valves; ball and cage, tilting disk and bi-leaflet. The valves were studied with 2D, steady state, turbulent models using Ansys Workbench CFD software. The bi-leaflet valve demonstrates the most promise for acceptable hemodynamics. Major complications caused by mechanical heart valve fluid flows include formation of clots, tissue overgrowth and damage to red blood cells. These side effects are the result of increased turbulent shear stress caused by large velocity gradients, regions of low velocity (stagnation) and recirculation and the formation of vortices. These were all examined in Ansys with the end result of altering the design of the valve to decrease the likelihood of these complications arising. Design changes identified included changing the shape of the leading edge of the valve leaflets to reduce flow separation and placing the leaflets directly parallel to the fluid flow (at zero angle of attack) thus reducing the disturbance to the flow downstream of the valve. This project demonstrates the significant contribution which CFD software can make to prosthetic heart valve design.",

        "description": "The purpose of this project is to design a proof of concept for a mobile application that allows retailers to collect data about their customers while they are shopping in-store. The use of Big Data is becoming a crucial way for leading companies to outperform their peers. In most industries, established competitors and new entrants alike will leverage data-driven strategies to innovate, compete, and capture value. Retailers are monitoring their customers path through the shops and their purchases - information which, in the aggregate, will be used to configure store layouts, decide what products to stock, and assist in making staffing decisions. This system, named RewardMe, will work by having the customer register their information when they download the app. They activate the app as they are beginning their shop. There are bluetooth sensors at the top and bottom of each aisle in the store, these sensors register when the customer has entered the aisle and when they exit it. As the customer is paying for their shopping the goods that they have bought are also registered, as is currently done with store loyalty cards. Using this system it is possible for a store to collect data on what the consumer bought in-store, what route the customer took around the store, and how much time they spend on each aisle. There are numerous incentives for customers to use this app including; discounted items for app users, entry into store competitions, and the customer will be rewarded loyalty points for not only the goods they purchase - as is currently done with loyalty cards - but also for walking through aisles. In addition to this, the app offers a shopping list feature which, if used by the customer, will allow stores to compare what a customer intended to buy with what they actually bought.",

The purpose of this project was to design and build a generator for the purpose of creating microbubbles. This generator, modelled on the theory of a converging-diverging nozzle, is designed to generate microbubbles through the sudden pressure change that is present within an expansion chamber. This design will produce microbubbles through pressurised water being pumped through the nozzle inducing a suction effect within the throat, this will effect will draw air in from the surrounding environment and causing the air and water to mix just past the throat. It is this mixture that will be broken up by means of a shockwave present within the outflow chamber of the nozzle caused by the differential pressure between the throat and the exit, thus creating microbubbles.",
