The use of decellularised coronary arteries as a scaffold for tissue engineered blood vessels provides great opportunities for future clinical and current research applications. Decellularisation is a process which involves the removal of all vascular cells and only the extracellular matrix remains. However, concerns remain regarding the long-term preservation and sterilisation of these scaffolds because the use of fresh tissue in a clinical setting is extremely impractical. Freezing offers a means of overcoming these concerns. This project aimed to investigate different types of freezing over specified time periods in order to determine an optimum method for long term preservation; freezing in standard freezer Vs freezing in liquid nitrogen. The effects of freezing the tissue both before and after decellularisation were also be investigated.",
