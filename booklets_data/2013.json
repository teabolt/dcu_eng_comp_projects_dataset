Additional features of the project include MP3 metadata display and support for opening and creating music playlists. The project will also include a server to stream the MP3s. This project comes from passion for music and recognising that streaming MP3 files from a server would be both convenient and useful. Many people like to listen to music but do not want to keep separate copies of the same music library on different machines. Other people like to listen to music, but they travel a lot and cannot be near their music library all the time. This project aims to solve both of these problems by letting users stream their music collections from a server.",

The aim of this project is to determine the effect of machine-product dedication policies within a manufacturing facility that is constrained by product changeover times when switching between the manufacturing of different product types. This is accomplished by comparing three possible layouts of a manufacturing facility with each layout having a unique machine-product dedication policy. The layouts are compared on two performance indices; process queuing times in each line and cycle times of both production lines and of individual products. Comparison of the individual layouts is achieved through the development of a simulation model of the three facility layouts which is then used to perform a simulation study of the facilities’ behaviour over 10,000 hours. The data collected from this simulation model is then used to calculate the performance indices of each layout. Following the conclusion regarding the most optimal machine-product dedication policy for this layout, the production volume level is varied in order to find the optimal level for this layout and comment on its relationship with the machine-product dedication policy and processing times of the stations. The manufacturing facility studied in this report is a facility with three processing lines, each line having three processing operations. The facility produces three individual product types at a defined ratio of 6:2:1 of Product 1, Product 2 and Product 3 respectively. The manufacturing facility examined is constrained by unscheduled down times of processing stations and by processing changeover times when switching between manufacturing products of different types.",

Two different exergy models are used as a comparison; one that uses recently updated thermodynamic properties of seawater and another that models seawater as an electrolytic solution. The contents of this project are deemed important as the exergy analysis assesses the efficiency of a system, and is a tool that will be used in future sustainable development projects where the aim is to minimise our carbon footprint by creating more efficient systems. During the analysis of the desalination plant the point of highest exergy destruction (lowest efficiency) was located in the MSF unit by both models, with a near identical percentage fraction of 76%. Knowing that decisions within industry will still be based on economic factors, thermoeconomics it is seen as an important tool that combines both the thermodynamic and economic factors, which is seen as a tool that will be used for basing future environmental decisions by policy makers. This concept is introduced with an application of the theory used on results obtained in the exergy analysis. Through the analysis it was found that the preferred model for the exergy analysis would be the model that bases seawater as an electrolytic solution opposed to an ideal solution.",

The project vehicle has a high centre of gravity and narrow wheel base. As such, the need for analysis of the vehicles mechanics is an important step in ensuring the vehicles overall stability and safety. Using the derived relationships safe operating limits for the vehicle were established which were then compared to empirically set operating parameters. Finally a controller function was designed in MATLAB to control the vehicles three drive motors ensuring the vehicle handled correctly, maintained stability and protected the operator from excessive acceleration. Through the completion of the project the conclusion was reached that the vehicles empirically set operating parameters ensured the vehicles stability. However these parameters exerted excessive acceleration on the user. A controller function was designed in MATLAB to control the vehicle in the desired manner whilst limiting excessive operator acceleration. The designed controller was then tested in Simulink using appropriate motor models. The designed controller correctly adjusted the rpm of the vehicle’s three drive motors ensuring operator safety under various circumstances.",

The main aims of this project are; -Design and develop an Erosion-Corrosion Testing Rig. -Test the erosion- corrosion behaviour of mild carbon steel with no protective coating. -Monitor the effect of salt Concentration (corrosive solution), high/low, on the erosion- corrosion process. A sandblaster in the R&D building lab was used as part of the test rig design to provide the abrasive material required for the erosion wear part and another unit was designed to provide the corrosive solution required to cause the corrosion wear effect with a use of a centrifugal water pump (stainless steel pump). The test rig designs and concepts were closely monitored by a skilled experienced team of people (the supervisor, lab technician and a workshop technician). The team assisted the author where necessary during the development stage of the project and finally after the approval of the final concept, the author provided the technical drawings and instructed the workshop technician to go ahead with the manufacturing of the test rig and the lab technician made the purchase of the order list made by the author. The report goes into detail on the literature of the types of wear, the parameters that accelerate the wear rate, some of the preventions and the combined effect of erosion-corrosion wear on a material. Then the project content shows step by step all the stages, design concept and final design and explaining into detail the function of each part of the assembly. In the results and discussion section, shows how the test rig operated and the conclusion drawn is test rig functions accordingly and recommendation are highlighted in order to improve the accuracy and better precession results of overall wear of erosion-corrosion effect.",

An Nd:YAG laser uses short pulsed laser wavelengths to create nanoparticles. There is an existing 1064nm Laser in the Advanced Processing Technology research centre in DCU. This report seeks to incorporate and expand on the research previously carried out on the 1064nm laser in the design and development of a 532nm laser. The 532nm laser, when complete, should enable the creation of finer nanoparticles, which will allow for a more detailed analysis of the nanostructures created.

Engineers in this field are responsible for many technological breakthroughs e.g. structural carbon fibre, advances in jet engine design, GPS navigation and Doppler radar. Aircraft technology has spread to all areas of modern life and has changed the world for the better. This project investigates one such technological advance ‘Autopilot Systems’ which owes its development to the aviation industry. Aircraft autopilot systems use sensors, actuators and computers to achieve autonomous control of an aircraft’s heading, altitude and orientation in space. The aim of this project was to design, build and test an autopilot demonstration rig using a sensor, microcontroller and actuator control system. The rig’s intended purpose was to act as an educational tool for explaining the principles of autopilot operation to students of AMPS-Aviation Management with pilot studies B.Sc. course at DCU. This project uses the Arduino platform to demonstrate the operation of roll and pitch control of a two axis autopilot system. The orientation of the rig’s platform to the horizon is measured using a MEMS gyro based sensor and the rig is actuated using servo motors connected by mechanical linkages to the platform. During operation, an instructor can move the rig and the control system will correct the orientation of the rig’s platform, maintaining an orientation parallel to the horizon. This allows the instructor to use the rig as a visual aid when explaining an autopilot’s operation to students.",

The vehicle was designed to be an environmentally friendly alternative to the common fossil fuel burning industrial site vehicles. The project was centred the motion analysis software in the SolidWorks CAD package. The project had three main aims: research the software motion analysis capabilities, design the loader mechanism for the existing three-wheeled vehicle chassis, and conduct a motion analysis on the mechanism design. Software was researched by analysing both a simplified single cylinder and a more complex two cylinder system. The findings from this research were then recorded into a step by step instruction manual for future reference. The design of the loader mechanism was separated into three sections including; bucket design, lift and stabilising arm design and tilt mechanism design. Three concepts were then designed and comparisons and assessments made to select the most effective design. This concept design was then improved to a final concept stage where additional features were added to produce the final design. A motion analysis was then carried on to the final design. Results in the form of forces, velocities and accelerations were then gathered, analysed and discussed. It was concluded that the software was capable of producing accurate responses for simplified systems that can simulate forces such as gravity, and contact between solid bodies. The design was also concluded to have been within all the design constraints and to meet all the necessary performance criteria. The design would function as required and perform all the necessary tasks, however the materials used could have been optimised more. The motion analysis of the final design was not perfect as the response did produce anomalies and errors. However it still provided an excellent approximation how the vehicle would operate when manufactured.",

The aim of CloudSync is to provide a cloud-based backup service to Android users, and to allow users to view and modify their information through a web application. It allows backup of important data, as XML, to a server, which stores the data under the users account. When a user loses/breaks their phone, they only have to login to CloudSync, and they can restore their data from the server easily. Because the application is laid out in such a way, the user can easily use CloudSync to move their information from one phone to another. CloudSync can backup 3 types of data: contacts, messages, and user files. Once backed up, users can view their data on the CloudSync web application. This shows them their contacts and messages, and a file manager lets them modify/rename/delete files from the server. Contacts can be edited, and messages deleted individually.

The aim of the project is to develop an autonomous on-site visual sensing platform which can act as part of a larger network of monitoring technologies. The platform developed must be both affordable and energy efficient. The Raspberry Pi embedded system was chosen to act as this autonomous monitoring device. While being quite affordable this device is also capable of performing very computationally intensive tasks. It also has very low power requirements. As part of this project the Raspberry Pi can interface with an Axis IP camera as well as other non-visual sensors, collecting both images and sensor readings. This data is used to intelligently alter the Raspberry Pi’s behaviour, possibly capturing images at a higher frame rate or going into a low power state. Image processing techniques including background subtraction are employed to analyse the scene and detect objects. This data can be combined with data from non-visual sensors to provide multi-modal sensing which can improve the robustness of event detection systems through the fusing of complementary data sources. Using a 3G USB dongle the Raspberry Pi can relay any images and data recorded back to a server in the cloud. This data can be then be archived for further processing and analysis. The entire system can be monitored and configured through a J2EE web application, with changes propagated out to the raspberry Pi and implemented in real time. Within this web application users can observe the latest images and data sent back as well as configure how the Raspberry Pi will react to incoming sensor data.",

Where this project’s Ballbot differs from previous NXT Ballbots is the use of a single accelerometer and gyroscope to relay the position and speed of the body in both planes of motion assuming the Ballbot does not move in its top plane. This project details the derivation of the equations of motion which will lead into the modelling, simulation and affective control of the Ballbot. A brief discussion on interfacing the NXT software with MATLAB is presented for explanatory purposes. The choices made towards the build of an NXT Ballbot and parameterising the Ballbot created plays a key role in the affective success of a Ballbot. The choices made as well as sensor selection and sensor testing are documented in the project report. Finally the effective control of the Lego Ballbot’s motors was carried out and is presented in this report. It presents two possible methods of creating the code for the controlled model and explains what can be done in to possibly obtain a better response from them.",

The project focused on the sensing of liquid spillages using a video camera. The image processing and analysis were performed using the OpenCV library. As part of another project a robot was developed that would be used for cleaning in hospitals. Currently the robot uses a procedure for spillage detection that requires human interaction. A nurse who identifies a spillage places a cone at its location. Using infra-red sensors the robot detects the cone and moves to the location that the cone was placed at. This project aimed at eliminating the need for the nurse in the spillage detection procedure. Instead the robot will use a webcam to automatically detect the spillage itself. This will improve the efficiency at which spillages are cleaned and therefore it will help improve the safety of the hospital. Image processing techniques were used to test different methods that could be used for spillage detection. Research and testing were carried out using a number of different image processing methods.",

        "description": "While the ‘gold standard’ treatment method for advanced atherosclerosis in coronary arteries remains bypass grafting, the need for an alternative technique is required now more than ever. The increased rate of occurrence of cardiovascular (CVD) worldwide, coupled with the limited supply of suitable vasculature replacement grafts have prompted studies into the development of tissue engineered blood vessels (TEBVs). This project investigates one such method, electrospinning, which can be used to create TEBV. A rotating collector, used for electrospinning, has been designed, manufactured and optimised to produce tubular scaffolds which could potentially be used in TEBV applications. PHBV was the polymer of choice for this project. A structured Design of Experiments was developed to examine the change in morphology of scaffolds, when subjected to parameter variance. Electrospun scaffolds were successfully created using this collector and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the resultant scaffolds was promising. Images obtained from the SEM show no apparent beading with fibre diameters of approximately 5.49+/-0.90 ìm. Fibre alignment, a feature which is imperative for TEBV applications, was also observed on the external surface of produced scaffolds. The process parameters for electrospinning were altered to observe their effect on fibre morphology, and an optimal setting for the collector was established. Although no conclusive results were obtained on porosity of the scaffolds, the experimentation conducted has provided the basis for further investigation into the area of TEBV development within the college. Additional features such as mechanical properties and cell seeding can be explored as a result of this project.",

The unique characteristics of the platform, when sufficiently developed, allow high manoeuvrability and unobtrusive operation in peopled environments. For such operations a highly capable control system is required. This project examines the control issues associated with the control of a Ballbot by first developing a planar model of the system and then modelling and simulating this planar model using MATLAB and Simulink. Control schemes are designed to control the tilt angle and the position of the Ballbot. These control schemes are based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) methods and examined with respect to the problem of balancing and station keeping and then adapted to include position tracking. The LQR method is found to give the best response overall and requires the least amount of time to design. The Model of the system is verified by direct comparison with previous works.",

        "description": "Current research is on-going in the field of ball balancing robots (ballbot). These robots are very flexible since they can any direction without first having to turn and then actuate. The simplified model of a ballbot constrained to one plane of motion resembles an inverted pendulum. This project required the design of the mechanical and electronic systems that will form an inverted pendulum test device. The main aim of this project is to quantify the use of a low power and low cost embedded system with MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) accelerometers and gyroscopes to address the traditional inverted pendulum control problem. This project also required the design of the mechanical test apparatus using a CAD package called SolidWorks. This was used to design the framework that would be fabricated by the school’s workshop. Embedded systems or microcontrollers are used to target specific problems, whether it is measurement, computation or control. Microcontrollers have become so popular and accessible in recent times that many companies are providing hobbyists with accessible development or evaluation platforms. An ARM M4F processor from Texas Instruments was used as it is a low cost device with huge functionality. It achieves 100 Million Instructions per Second (MIPS) at 80 MHz. Code Composer Studio was used to develop the C code for the microcontroller. The accelerometers and gyroscope used were internal on a device called an ArduIMU. This Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is an Arduino based device; it was initially developed for an open source autopilot or drone application. It features 2 accelerometers (combined x-y direction accelerometer and an independent z direction accelerometer) and a three axis gyroscope to achieve 6 degrees of freedom. The ArduIMU also has a processor onboard (Atmega328 at 16 MHz) to do some signal processing such as ADC and sensor fusion before presenting a serial output to the Microcontroller. The IMU was tested against a rotary encoder to quantify its measurement.",

The system will allow you to search for a medical service (a doctor, a physiotherapist, a dentist etc.) that is located close to your location. You must also choose the medical service that you would like and also input your symptoms for the search. You will then be presented with a result list of chosen doctors or dentists etc. You can click on the chosen result and will be brought to their real-time calendar page. On this page you can then click an available time-slot and create a booking. While the main component of the system is the we application, there will also be an app available on the Android and iOS platforms. On the app you will be able to view your bookings, make bookings and also search for the closest medical services to your location just like on the web app. The app will be simple in features and what it can do as we want it to be a quick and efficient experience for the users. The system will be launched in the Irish market at first and then we will look at expanding into the English market and other European markets. The MediFind system will benefit practices that are very busy with bookings. It will also help practices that are struggling to get patient bookings for whatever reason. Having a presence online will help to advertise these practices and potentially create more business for them. The main objective of the MediFind system is to help make the medical services industry more profitable in Ireland and other markets.",

There are three states to the internet controlled security robot that was developed in this project. The robot is autonomous: meaning that it can drive by itself, it can be manually driven: meaning that it can be driven online with a video games controller and it can be in a standby state, whereby the robot can be activated upon detecting motion in the area. When the robot is autonomous it uses an IR distance sensor mounted upon a servo motor to scan a number of distances from the robot to walls or objects. From this information it can make a decision of where to travel. When the robot is manually driven, a WiFly module is used to connect to the WiFi in the area and using a computer, the controls of a Playstation 3 controller can be mapped to send packets of data to the robot to drive it. The project uses an open source programming environment called Processing and a library called ProControls to map the PS3 buttons to code. The project uses a UDP library to send UDP packets to the robot. This is a connectionless protocol which means instant control of the robot with fast response from the controller. Also used was a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor as a motion detector. When the robot is in standby as soon as there is movement it triggers the robot to connect to the WiFi and giving alert to a security guard to get on the controls. When the user is controlling the robot, packets of data are sent back from the robot based on the IR sensor’s distances.

The creation of hybrid Kanban - CONWIP models is extremely popular in the field of operations research. This project undertakes the analysis of newly created BK-CONWIP D-KAP and BK-CONWIP S-KAP models against the HK-CONWIP model and tests the influence of the decoupling of demand signals and production authorization. Comparative tests against previously tested models are done on a two product line with 3 stages in series. The lines are then increased to 3 products to test for flexibility and robustness of the models in question. In order to fully understand the behaviour of the hybrid models, an approach that uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm was then undertaken for the models’ retests. In a two product environment, initial tests suggested that the BK-CONWIP S-KAP and HK-CONWIP D-KAP were equal performers in terms of satisfying 95% satisfaction levels with the least amount of work-in-progress. Further analysis with the multi-objective genetic algorithm showed HK-CONWIP D-KAP to be the most efficient performer of the three. In a three product environment, with high demand variability, the BK-CONWIP models outperformed the HK-CONWIP. BK-CONWIP models are suitable for environments with a high number of variables and high amount of risk due to the decoupling of demand information from production authorization. It has also been found through sensitivity analysis that mutation rate affects the solution space searched and the accuracy and precision of the non-dominated solutions created by the Pareto Optimiser. The number of replications has an effect on the number of solutions produced, although it is at a cost of high simulation time. The right combination of mutation rate and number of replications is desirable for efficient and effective testing and analysis.",

The SODIS method requires minimal supplies and uses solar energy that is free and abundant in many developing countries where there is a scarcity of safe potable water. There are several limitations to the traditional SODIS method however. This project investigates the viability of air injection in the traditional SODIS process. Potential benefits of air injection in the SODIS process include improved efficiency, reliability and applicability of the SODIS method for large and turbid volumes of water. Air injection and the proceeding formation of gas bubbles aids in increasing mixing in the water, increasing dissolved oxygen content in the water and increasing UV penetration in the water volume, all of which increase the efficiency of the SODIS process. In order to study the effects of air injection in SODIS a SODIS reactor with an incorporated air injection system was designed and manufactured. The reactor includes treatment vessels to carry 2L of water and a solar reflector to maximise levels of UV and thermal radiation reaching the treatment vessels. The reactor is ideal for hydrodynamic, thermodynamic and microbiological testing of SODIS with air injection. A wind turbine also developed through the course of this project can power the air injection system. The application of air injection in SODIS is an entirely new concept and this project successfully opens the doors to further research into this area.",

One of the solutions that have been presented is to use renewable energy to help supply the demand for energy; with this in mind this project proposes a way to convert the energy of the sun using solar panels to power our everyday applications at home. The idea is simple the power we get from the solar panels is DC and in order for us to use this harvested power we need to invert it to AC, that’s where the name ‘Solar Inverter’ came from. After a lot of research, design and effort put in this project it was able to take the 12 volts DC input from the solar panels and invert it to 230 volts AC output, this allows the output to act as a mains plug, although the power output is low, but for different solar panels the inverter can go up to 150 watts. This involved stepping up the voltage using a DC - DC converter circuit and then inverting it to AC using an DC to AC inverter, proving the concept of being able to use solar panels to power household electronics, and we can depend on this type of energy technology to partially power our houses, leading a start towards leaving the conventional energy production and moving to a clean energy.",

To achieve this, a dynamic value stream map model was created in a software package. A case study was conducted on a traditional value stream map by using the dynamic model to experiment with dynamic simulation. A number of tests were performed on the case study model to assess any benefits that could be found. The model provided dynamic outputs representing inventory queue lengths and wait times. These outputs were graphed and examined in order to implement improvements on the production line. In addition to the case study, a market survey was circulated to obtain information on the current use of value stream mapping and the interest in a dynamic value stream mapping package. Value stream mapping was found to be a widely used tool in the organisations who responded and there was a largely positive response to the proposal of a dynamic value stream mapping tool. Overall there were a number of benefits found during the project such as increased value stream accuracy and dynamic output data. Implementation of dynamic value stream mapping was deemed to be limited by time, knowledge and cost constraints within organisations. This would create a large barrier especially for small businesses where a simple traditional value stream map would be more suited.",

The device remained a theoretical item until recently when HP developed a physical device made from TiO2. The aim of this project is firstly to examine the physical properties, the operation and the I-V characteristics of the device that result in it having memory. Secondly, different models of the device, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, are examined and compared. Nonlinear exponential models are the most closely related to the real-world properties of the physical device. Finally, a memristor based ultra wide-band (UWB) receiver which utilises the memory properties of the devices is simulated showing a unique application of the device. This is advantageous as it avoids the problems with analogue to digital converters at very high operating rates. This project presents the reader with a solid introduction to memristors and provides evidence of how its unique behaviour can be utilised in solving problems that resistor, capacitor and inductor circuits have not been able to resolve.",

It re-emerged this year in an attempt to improve environmental monitoring. The continuation of this project integrates mechanical design elements and electronic control using a microcontroller to produce an automated sampler. The report discusses the importance for the constant need for environmental monitoring by research conducted into the existing methods. The existing method is time consuming and requires extensive preparation. An alternative method of analysis, XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) is discussed with respect to accuracy and speed. This project’s aim is to develop a soil sampler that can, in future works, incorporate XRF analysis into a fully automated dust/soil sampler. The mechanical design aspect of this project was to improve on an existing design of a filter changer used for collecting dust samples. The new design’s intent is successful in holding an XRF analyser in a position suitable to analyse dust samples. To embrace the new design, modifications of the existing design are used to assist the integration of the new design and the old design. The electronic control of this project combines microcontroller programming along with power management. The microcontroller controls two stepper motors and a micro- pump. It controls each of these in a way to present samples onto a stage where an XRF analyser can sample.",

The common objective is continuous improvement as small turbines exist in the shadow of large commercial wind farms. Ideas from commercial turbines and aerospace are being redesigned for easy incorporation into the small homebuilt turbine and one of these ideas is variable pitch. Variable pitch promises lower cut-in wind speed, better aerodynamic performance, and good speed control to reduce noise, vibration and long term stress on the turbine. This project will investigate what problems variable pitch is trying to solve and how it solves those problems. During the course of this project the same problems encountered by small prototype builders when they tried to incorporate variable pitch were encountered. Judging by the lack of small wind turbines with variable pitch the same conclusions were arrived at as well.",

Users have their own profile and can follow spaces and other people, by following a space they will get the latest updates and news associated to those spaces, by following a user they will learn about contributions and reviews a user has made to the network. The application consists of a couple of areas, such areas are the explore section where users can learn about what is nearby, they can easily change the coverage area which will change the results the user will see. Next we have the News Stream, it contains updates and news about whats nearby and subscribed people and spaces. Users can easily find what spaces are nearby by clicking the nearby button in the top right of the application, they will be presented with a map with a number of markers based around their location, these markers represent spaces. A space also contains products that users can easily add to a space, they can take a photo of the product, add a description and post it to the network. Users can review these products and rate the product by clicking either love or unlike. A space also contains locations, locations are sub-locations of the space, these would be a room inside an office building or a school. A user can click on a location and learn more about it, locations can also be placed on different floors, a user can easily go up or down floors. A user must be in a space in order to add a location as the location is based on their current geographical location. The iOS application was built using Objective-C and the Xcode environment, the server was built using PHP and for the database MySQL was used.",

        "description": "This project outlines the conception of a number of sensing methods for the design of a spillage sensing device that will be used in conjunction with a fleet of autonomous hospital robots in a hospital environment in the EU-funded IWARD project. A number of European universities were tasked with developing each part of the robot, with DCU being assigned the module development. As part of this module development, specifically in conjunction with the cleaning module, a spillage sensing device needed to be developed. This project outlines the testing of conceptual sensing ideas for such a device, utilizing photoelectric sensors and electrical conductivity sensors. The photoelectric sensors are used to measure surface reflectivity. When the sensor is moved over a spill, the light reflected off that spill will be different to the light reflected by the floor. The electrical conductivity sensor works in a similar manner, except it monitors the electrical conductance between two probes in contact with the floor. When a conductive material crosses both probes (e.g. water), a signal is sent to a robot that a spill has been detected. It was found after extensive testing, that two different types of photoelectric diffuse sensors (infrared and visible light) were capable of detecting a number of liquid spills on two different floor types (matte floors and shiny floors). Also, the conductivity sensor was able to detect a number of liquid spills on the same two floor types, in addition to many other electrically conductive materials. It was concluded that the sensing methods outlined in this report were successful at detecting liquid spills, and therefore could be carried on for further development of the spillage sensing device.",

This was done through the creation of a game that asks the user to hit targets at random, over a period of 60 seconds. The aim of this project was to determine what is the best way to distribute feedback to users, and show how much of an impact this has on how quickly they will improve at the game. In order to do this the idea of the Batak test was used and a version of this was built. This was then connected to a Makey-Makey invention kit, and a program was created that provided the user with commands which they must complete. The Makey-Makey invention kit provides the ability to use any object to replace a keyboard function. This allows this reaction test to be customizable with any conductible object being used as an interface with the reaction test. With advice from members of the School of Health and Human Performance staff, a number of different test groups were used to conduct the tests. The groups received different types of feedback which had an impact on their ability and rate of improvement. This project aimed to show the importance of ecological learning and how feedback is important in improving performance. Each group received a different type of feedback, for example; one group received feedback after every test; one group received feedback after every session of tests; one group received no feedback; the final group received corrupted feedback.",

Today’s mobile phones are not just used for making and receiving phone calls, but also to listen to music, watch videos, GPS navigation, web surfing, updating software, playing games and much more. They have become small PCs in our hands. A big problem in the mobile world is that the devices are battery powered, and the battery technologies do not match the required energy demand of compute-intensive applications. The aim of this project is to find an efficient way to increase battery life. In order to do this, the first step is to evaluate the power consumption of the various phone components and applications, and their effect on battery life. Based on the data collected, we developed an app to inform users of the top contenders for energy drain, allowing them to choose those applications which are easier on the battery. It also allows configuration changes to the device and its screen that prolong battery life, such as image adaptation, and innovative playback schemes that seamlessly vary the screen brightness, thereby optimising the energy consumption. Once our app is started it runs in the background. It gives a warning popup message if the battery level is reduced to 25%. It automatically reduces the brightness of the phone and changes the wallpaper to black background. It also provides a list of applications responsible for most battery consumption, allowing them to be turned off if they are not required. If the battery is not charged and further reduces to 10% of total power, it again shows a reminder to stop all of the out-of-use applications that are consuming power. If phone users use the app with the simple battery saving setting, the phone is a lot less likely to die on them when they need it most. In the course of the project I gained lot of knowledge on Android-based Smartphones. I learnt about different display technologies, and operating system features and programming for mobile devices. I had fun in developing the application, encountering bugs and then rising to the challenge of debugging them.",

A buck converter converts voltage on one level to voltage on another level. It finds applications in a wide range of sectors such as communications, consumer electronics and the health sector. A controller is required for load regulation to maintain the output voltage at a desired level. Traditionally, analog controllers were used. However, digital control techniques are superior owing to lower sensitivity, reprogrammability and the possibility for more sophisticated control techniques. Yet, the occurrence of limit cycles prevents its widespread adoption. Limit cycles are oscillations of the regulated output under steady state conditions. They occur due to quantization in the digital controller. They are cycles or oscillations of the regulated output. They are generally undesirable as they degrade the output performance. This research aims to address these issues and aid the widespread adoption of digital controllers. Firstly, the research examines the occurrence of limit cycles in an ideal buck converter. Extra elements are then added to bring the model closer to real world models. The research investigates their effect on the occurrence and nature of limit cycles. The research establishes that, as the equivalent series resistance increases the amplitude of the limit cycle decreases until the limit cycle is eliminated. The research then proceeds to study the effect of frequency on the amplitude of the limit cycles. Bounds are established for each frequency. The effects of the controller parameters are then examined. The occurrence of limit cycles was found to be dependent on each of these values. Finally, filtering is explored as a method for the elimination of limit cycles. Two filters were considered; a notch filter and a comb filter.",

For each clinical case several possible combinations of plates and screws exist. The surgeon will commonly calculate the area moment of inertia (AMI) of each construct in order to determine which construct has the most favourable bending behaviour. These calculations can be quite distracting for the surgeon who doesn’t have a background in engineering or mathematics. The main objective of this final year project was to develop a Smartphone app that will automatically calculate the area moment of inertia of a bone-plate construct based on input values from the user. The app takes in user values for the dimensions of the plate and bone and uses these to calculate the combined AMI of the construct.

Pluronic F-127 was used as the raw material for the polymeric micelles. Pluronic micelles have gained much interest in drug delivery applications because of their ability to form micelles, to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, and to avoid opsonisation and clearance by RES (reticuloendothelial system). Similar studies have been performed many times elsewhere using fluorescent dyes or drugs with fluorescent properties (fluorophores) which are often toxic and highly expensive. As an alternative to these, a mixture of analytical techniques was used to characterise the release of the non-toxic, inexpensive hydrophobic dye, Oil Red O, from polymeric micelles using HPLFU. The micelles were characterised and measured using dynamic light scattering. Neither vision from the naked eye, UV-vis spectrophotometry nor fluorescence spectrometry was successful in characterising the release of the dye from micelles. This was not to say that the dye was not being released but rather there was little observable change in its absorption between the hydrophobic core of the micelles and the aqueous solution. Therefore it was concluded that Oil Red O is not an appropriate non-toxic alternative to fluorophores for characterising the release of the contents of micellar hydrophobic cores using HPLFU.",

FEA allows the prediction of the interfragmentary strains experienced at the various gap sizes, from the displacements at the fracture gap. The optimal interfragmentary strain for bone healing is between 2-10% such that certain fracture gaps and material thicknesses may not be suitable. The simulations are carried out on a model of the human tibia with forces representing the patient standing on one, and both legs. It was found that Kevlar/BCP composite was the best material to promote bone healing, with a fracture gap size of 3mm as under these conditions the most favourable strains were experienced.

On the website users have the option to upload and rename audio files just as they would in a conventional music library. Music can be played back through the site which uses HTML5’s built in audio player. An Android app has also been created that allows users to log into their account and play back their audio files on their device. HTML5 is a relatively new mark-up language but is supported by the latest versions of all mainstream browsers. It allows audio playback without any software needed on the computer as well as many other advantages. Mobile data speeds look set to improve dramatically this year with the state selling 4G licenses and the mobile network ‘3’ have announced they intend to launch a 4G service in August.",

It was designed to run in real time as developers work, to provide immediate feedback about any issues as they’re introduced. ESP runs silently in the background, only activating after developers stop typing so as not to disturb their normal workflow. ESP is also highly configurable, with scanning rules externalised in simple XML files. This lets support for new libraries and any custom internal packages a company may use to be deployed easily. Warnings generated by ESP integrate with the look and feel of Eclipse, appearing like syntax markers within the editor window. The messages displayed by these warnings can be customised in a similar way to scanning rules. Created in Java, ESP leverages the Java Development Tool API provided by Eclipse to create an Abstract Syntax Tree which can then be analysed for patterns that indicate security bugs. ESP is released under the MIT License. More information on the project, including source code and an installation site for Eclipse, is available at http://www.espsecurityplugin.com",

The application builds a user profile on a shopper and will send notifications of retail outlets which are of close proximity that sells goods and services which the shopper has indicated they have an interest in. Upon download and installation the Anois system uses the GPS location of the shoppers smartphone and searches for retail outlets which sells goods or services suited to the user that are close to them. The application will send a notification message to a user’s smartphone, informing the user of a product or service that they have a genuine interest in, that is physically close to their location. Anois also aims to tackle the inconveniences which shoppers regularly have to deal with in terms of deal notifications. Various deal applications often inform users of ‘deals’ which are of little or no interest to them. Through the establishment of the user profile, shoppers will be enabled to receive deal notifications which are more suited to their taste and more likely to purchase. The value of this product can be seen when a potential customer is walking through town or a shopping centre. Though gps location, and the phone accelerometer, when a user is judged to be most likely shopping close to a store with products included in our database, they will be made aware of the availability / closeness of the product. The user will not be bombarded with many products that they may or may not have a real a interest in. The best matched product and most likely for future investigation from the user will be sent. Through the development of an application such as this one it is hoped that it will act as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Due to the decrease in sales from physical outlets as a result in growth from online shopping this application when installed on a user’s device may trigger an impulse for the customer to make a purchase from a physical retail outlet.",

Sustainable and green energy is beginning to play a more prominent role in modern industry, as people begin to realise that the world’s fossil fuel based approach cannot last forever. This report set out to investigate the thermodynamic efficiency and financial cost of an industrial chiller based at the National Metrology Laboratory. In order to calculate these values, a number of measurements needed to be taken. These include measuring the temperature at different points along the refrigeration cycle, noting pressure values at different points on the cycle and measuring the electrical power input to the chiller during normal operating conditions. The temperature values were measured using a data-logging software package called Pico. This was installed on the author’s laptop. Applying the temperature and pressure values to the refrigerant’s pressure-enthalpy chart allowed the calculation of the chiller’s coefficient of performance. This was calculated as 9.75. The chiller’s maximum coefficient of performance was calculated as 10.03. The electrical power input to the chiller was measured using a clamp-on wattmeter. This power input in kW was converted to kWh and an approximate financial value was calculated using information from the NML’s monthly electricity bills. The approximate yearly cost of the chiller to the NML is €14,240. The proximity of the chiller’s coefficient of performance to its maximum coefficient of performance leads to a belief that the chiller is operating as well as possible. This is a likely outcome, as the chiller is relatively new, having been installed in 2007.",

        "description": "This project was undertaken with the support of Stryker Orthopaedics. The purpose of the project was to analyse the femoral component of a total knee replacement system following a sintering process. This particular sintering step is designed to attach tiny beads to the bone-implant surface thus providing improved fixation as the bone cells merge with the surface of the implant. The main focus of the project is to establish the mechanical differences between the parts that have been beaded and standard implants and to analyse their behaviour during manufacturing. The sintering process requires that the implants be subjected to 3 extra heat cycles in comparison to the average implant. The maximum heat reached during the sintering cycle is above the cobalt-based alloys recrystallization temperature which consequently leads to an effect on the implants microstructure. The project consisted of two main sections: tensile testing to establish the material properties of both the sintered and non-sintered implants and finite element analysis representing a particular process step within the Stryker production line. The purpose of the FEA was to establish whether or not the sintered parts were more likely to fail under the constraints of this particular process step. Tensile testing established that sintering has no effect on the Vitallium yield strength or on the Young’s Modulus. It does however increase the implants plasticity, with an increase in both failure strain and ultimate tensile strength. FEA verified that sintered implants are more susceptible to failure during manufacturing than the standard implant. It also verified that the lateral half of the implant experiences a higher stress than the medial. The FEA analysis had many drawbacks however; poor mesh quality and a software coding error inhibited the results. It was concluded that the sintering process has a definite effect of the material properties of Co-Cr-Mo implants. The true extent of this effect has not been established within this report but has been indicated. Further works in microstructural analysis would clarify the physical changes experienced by the alloy following heat treatment while repeat tensile testing with a larger sample size would remove ambiguity from the results obtained during this project.",

Most people nowadays have ever expanding collections of music, with many carrying a portion of these collections in their phones, either locally or on some server stored in the ‘cloud’. A prime example of this is Google’s music service. This sparked the original idea for the project, to in essence extend Google’s music service with other storage options such as Dropbox which is not made for music streaming and combine these into one application that streams music from these sources over the network, or music that is stored locally on a user’s phone. The original concept enabled me to expand the application to support other services such as providing streaming support for SoundCloud and ‘now-playing’ notifications to the Last.fm music recommendation service. JaM Player makes use of multiple API’s related to these cloud services to get streamable url and metadata information, some third-party and some directly developed from the service vendors. The use of Dropbox presented some interesting challenges in forming metadata efficiently for mp3s which required research into online music database services, notably Gracenote, which JaM Player uses to form Gracenote search queries based on filenames and Pulse-Code Modulation.",

There is a large emphasis on the social aspects of discovering and sharing events. WOWit acts as a way of bringing social networks of friends together, easily allowing them to discover what events their friends are attending. The social stream of the mobile app links in with the Facebook API allowing users to view what events their friends are attending as well as suggested events and offers that promoters are pushing out. Promoters will be able to target specific demographics using the analytical data available to them with special offers and deals that will encourage users who have been to their events before to come back again as well as users who have been to similar events. As WOWit will have a database of users information, it can be anonymised and passed onto promoters. We can tell promoters where their customers came from, what college they go to, gender, age groups and even anonymous social circles. This analytical data will be invaluable to the promoter. For example. WOWit will notify the promoter when birthdays are approaching allowing the promoter to offer that person special offers. There will also be a WOWit API where we can pass anonymised data onto third-parties like taxi companies. Information such as how many people are in a venue and where they live is invaluable information to a taxi driver. WOWit will also provide promoters with analytical data to let them see anonymised details on whoever comes to their events. WOWit focuses on the long tail of the market, targeting promoters who otherwise would not be able to sell tickets to events very easily online.

Due to the balancing nature of the Ballbot, position control is not a trivial task. The outputs of the sensors need to be reliable and accurate enough to ensure the positioning of the Ballbot is unobtrusive in a human environment. The feedback from sensors must also be capable of rectifying the position of the Ballbot should it experience external forces. The sensors selected for the application are a gyroscope and an accelerometer. Through the use of digital filtering techniques in MATLAB software, the disadvantages of both sensors can be attenuated while maintaining the advantages. A Complementary filter technique with high-pass and low-pass filters was employed to perform sensor fusion of the accelerometer and gyroscope data. Low-pass filters were utilised to remove high frequency noise from the accelerometer while high-pass filters removed the low frequency drift experienced by the gyroscope. Initially, basic first order high-pass and low-pass filters were designed and implemented in MATLAB. It was observed that some smoothing occurred. However by implementing the Butterworth variation of low- pass and high-pass filters, the smoothing effect improved. Higher order filters were implemented for both the basic and Butterworth filter types. It was found that the smoothing effect for Butterworth filters improved significantly as the filter order increased, however, this increase in order also caused a time lag. For use in a robotic application, it was concluded that a compromise between smoothing and time lag would have to be defined.",

The sensor is capable of capturing the movement of a player and wirelessly transmitting the data to a receiver connected to a computer. Extensive testing was carried out using the sensor to establish a threshold between the different stages of motion such as walking and jogging. The use of this threshold is used in the development of a small piece of coding in Microsoft Excel. The programme developed is capable of detecting different events a footballer would endure during a football match from the data retrieved by the sensor. The collected data is then used to identify performance aspects which the user of the boot can improve.",

The application will use the GPS from an android phone to find the user’s location (via its longitude and latitude). Then a script file will run to compare the location, to that of stored deals in the database. The deal which is nearest the users location will then be returned to the user. The user has the option to choose to get the directions to the deal, and the relevant information will be set up in the maps application. There will be only 3 options on the homepage to keep the program easy to use. The 3 options are: My Location - Here, the user finds their location, and the offers which are available in their area. All Deals - Here, the user see all of the offers which are stored in the database. If this option is chosen a string will be returned to the user containing all the relevant deals and offers. The user can select one, and get the directions to the location of the deal. Help - this will be a general help section, informing the user about the application and how to use it.",

        "description": "Our final year project is a proof of concept project called Review Technology. It is a software application that will sit on websites that contain online user reviews. The aim is to provide an overview of all reviews for the product/service, through the use of graphics. The goal is to combat the issue of biased reviews or reviews based on a once off negative experience, as this may affect the opinion of those reading reviews, even when they may not actually be an accurate portrayal of the product/service. Opposed to the user having to read through all the past reviews to get an accurate idea of the overall view of the product/service, they will be able to view a summary of all reviews in different forms of visualizations. The visualizations our project will be focusing on are; word clouds, trend graphs and graphs containing basic statistics of all past reviews and sentiment analysis graphs. The final feature we propose is a search function, which will allow users to search all reviews and filter them to show ones containing a keyword or words. Through this users can look at reviews for a specific topic in relation to that product or service. The word cloud will show users key words that have been mentioned frequently in reviews, so they will have an idea of key topics discussed about this product or service. The word cloud is able to filter out pronouns and conjunctions so that irrelevant words are not displayed in the final cloud. In our proposed functionality, the words will be hyperlinked to a page which will display some statistics of the use of that word in reviews and listing all reviews that word is listed in. The trending topics graph will show frequently talked about topics and over what time span they were talked about for. This will then be able to take into account reviews covering a topic that was only relevant for a short period of time. Graphs with Sentiment Analysis (Positive or Negative Feedback) will be a feature of the software. Using Sentiment Analysis Algorithms, our software will be able to distinguish positive reviews from negative reviews. We will then use the results to provide a summary of the opinions of all reviewers. The final feature we propose is a search function, which will allow users to search all reviews and filter them to show ones containing a keyword or words.

        "description": "LMS is a unique web application that looks to solve a common problem for many individuals whilst leasing a property. Traditionally information between a landlord and a tenant is not well documented or stored in an efficient manner. This leads to potential ambiguities between the two parties, something which can be avoided by using LMS. Our dedicated web application is intended to take the stress out of leasing, not only for the landlord but also for their tenants, and does so in a variety of ways. It centrally stores all the documentation associated with leasing a property, from tenant information forms and inventory lists to utility readings and maintenance procedures. Our application is built around flexibility, allowing all parties of a lease agreement to login and check certain details that are contained within the application. For example a landlord can have the ability of logging into the system and checking what properties in his portfolio are currently occupied, the contact information for the tenants and what bills associated with the lease are currently outstanding. A tenant is also afforded the opportunity to login to the system and have access to information on the property they are currently leasing. A tenant is capable of checking what rent is due, when the next house inspection is scheduled for and the landlord contact information. The main reason for using such a web application is the fact that either party can access the system at any time, from any location and from any device, be it mobile, desktop or tablet connected to the internet. As a result neither party is restricted by the other party, and can find out information regarding the property with click of a button. LMS has also incorporated additional functionality into the application, which allows users to request maintenance work for a property. The user submits the nature of their request through the online submission form, and a list of approved tradesmen quote prices for the job. The user can then pick the tradesman for the job and schedule the work.",

These devices have a large force capacity, fast response time, high dynamic variety, mechanical simplicity and low power requirements making them interesting and useful new components in modern suspension systems. This project is carried out to produce a new concept design of MR damper which combines the workings of existing conventional dampers with those of an MR damper. The aims of this study are as follows: i. To improve conventional damper efficiency and reliability by applying MR fluid technology to the design. ii. To reduce the cost of MR damper design by reducing the MR fluid amount in the design. iii. To improve the damper safety in case the magnetic field ceases operation, since the damper can be work by all abilities of a conventional damper. The aims of this project were achieved through investigative modelling and examination of MR fluid material (MRF-140 CG) produced by Lord Corporation for characterising a new MR fluid damper. The Finite Element Method Magnetic (FEMM) software package was used to simulate the damper and the magnetic circuit design. The MR damper technology presented in this project has shown a great development in cost reduction, geometry size and proven results that it is capable of carrying a large amount of damping force. The manufactured prototype damper and all its design considerations are discussed in detail as well as the ethics that accompany these design decisions and the testing and implementation of the design for practical applications.",

Online banking is one of the most common places we meet the two-step login process, but with increased user awareness, demand for a more secure login on web applications, such as email and social networks, is increasing. Google have created a smartphone application, “Google Authenticator” that will generate codes to be used for the second stage of the login process. The source code for the application is open source, enabling developers to incorporate it into their application. The aim of this project is to develop a secure framework that uses “Google Authenticator” in its authentication process. The result of this project is a web service and client application that use the 2-step process. The web service allows multiple applications that use the same user set, to manage their user creation, login and authentication. The client application is a simple website that uses the web service to handle its user authentication. The client site also implements several other methods of securing user data, such as password encryption and TLS.",

As for now, most of our Internet usage rely on a protocol designed nearly 40 years ago for wired networks: TCP. It has numerous drawbacks when used over a wireless networks, as segments can be lost randomly and the delay can vary significantly. Research teams have been working on alternatives or modifications to the TCP protocol in the past 15 years. Usually protocol modifications can only be simulated, as we need a wide acceptance in the Internet infrastructure for them to be really used. The goal with this project was to design and develop a proxy infrastructure -- allowing a real-world use --, in conjunction with a new network protocol: Coded- TCP. This new protocol has been proposed in 2012 by a team at MIT to solve the low performances problem of TCP over packet-erasure networks. The protocol has been implemented and the system has been deployed to the proxy system. It can now be used to enhance performances of mobile devices such as phones or laptop connected to packet-erasure networks like some 3G networks or WiFi hotspots.",

This is due to its responsibility in producing food for the world and the significant economic benefit that it gives to various work sectors. IntelliFarm is an android based application that provides users in the farming industry with a range of different tools that assist with various farm management activities. IntelliFarm provides readily accessible tools that relate to key farming activities of: Livestock management (Dairy, Beef, Sheep, Pig Farming) Crop management (spray, yield, sowing rates) Feed Management (Feed rations, fodder etc.) Grass Measurement (Calculation of grass available) Nitrates Calculator (to assure compliance with the nitrates directive). Our application houses the operational capability to record key livestock management statistics (i.e. medication, AI dates), feed and crop details. In conjunction with these recording tools there are also grass and nitrates calculation facilities. Monitoring farm activities can prove to be quite a difficult challenge for farm owners and operator personnel therefore adequate time and task management is of the upmost importance. The mobile application market directed at agricultural industries around the world is vast and highly competitive. IntelliFarm as an android application boasts a multifunctional set of helpful farm management tools delivered within one app. Current mobile applications aimed at agricultural farming industries are broad in terms of functionality but are lacking different tools in one application. The majority of farming apps charge users for separate functional tools released in separate apps. This is not the case with IntelliFarm as cross functional management tools are housed essentially ‘under the same roof’. IntelliFarm functions off the notion of simplicity but follows the concept of a dynamic utility making it an appealing choice to anyone working on a farm. As the world of farming operations continues to move away from the concept of recording important details with a pen and paper a mobile management application is not only viable but a universally attractive prospect.",

This Android mobile application is designed to resolve this issue. Nearly all products available can be identified by their barcode. Using integrated libraries I have created a unique barcode scanning app. Unlike barcode scanners which are already available on the Android Market that need to be positioned perfectly along a red scan line, in this app a barcode will be detected and analysed regardless of position or rotation. The corresponding barcode number is extracted from the product. An internet search is then done on this figure, checking first for a match on the UPC database, followed by a Google search if no result is found. HTML parsing is then used to retrieve the product’s title. This information is read out to the user using built in Text-to-Speech technology. The user then has the option to enter their opinion of this product using Speech-to-Text and the mobile’s microphone. This information is then saved to a database which is stored locally on the phone. This means that the next time this same barcode is scanned the user will not need an internet connection and the information will be retrieved from the database. This is a fully functioning mobile app which is in line with Android accessibility guidelines to allow blind users navigate and use the app with confidence and ease.",

TravelPal provides a feature rich information system to the end user empowered by Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. TravelPal provides seamless access to extensive tourist attraction information through one core entry point replacing the necessity for brochure stands within hotels, attraction sites and airports. Within an Irish attraction site today, Point of Interest [POI] content is generally presented in English to the visitor via information boards. By use of NFC tags positioned on these boards or in close proximity to the POI, a visitor may scan the tag using their mobile device and TravelPal will present Point of Interest information through multiple content forms by way of Text, Image, Audio and Video in the language of their choosing. TravelPal allows visitors from both overseas and domestic markets to fully immerse themselves in Ireland’s heritage along with strongly enhancing the attraction experience for visitors with reading disabilities or the visually impaired. TravelPal further provides users with an option to locally store all POI content prior to attraction site arrival in order to avoid costly data roaming charges along with location based recommendations and social network integration. Through mobile application usage, TravelPal captures real time data on each visitor to an attraction site. This data is then presented to attraction site management via an interactive real time analytics dashboard facilitating data driven business decisions. Unique data such as total visitors, gender analysis, nationality analysis, age analysis, POI analysis, throughput analysis, date range analysis, promotional analysis and much more is provided allowing management to gain a unique competitive insight into their site, for example, determine the top 10 POI and promotional offer success. Although, TravelPal is primarily developed for the Irish Tourism Industry, the underlying concept can be channelled into other markets such as the Hospitality, Retail and Corporate sector.",

Developed using the Lua Love Framework, it is primarily for the Windows platform. The dynamic generation of content is primarily focused on the terrain of the game world, and it uses a variation of the dungeon generation algorithm to achieve this generation. The games objective in simple terms is that you must take control of the player character, and guide it through the procedurally generated maze avoiding any AI enemies or traps you encounter on the way. The camera of the game focuses on the current room the player inhabits. Adjacent rooms will be generated as the player continues through the maze and stored in memory until the determined room limit has been reached. Each room is generated from a template, and then the overall game world is constructed in such a way as to not provide any scenarios which the player cannot complete.",

The purpose of the application is to facilitate communication for users with similar interests. The core idea of the application is to rate people according their activities and interests in particular areas, and to automatically generate lists of other users with similar interests. When a person has accomplished an everyday activity (such as finished a project at work, went to a movie, participated in an event), he/she then records the activity in the application and gets a +1 score in the particular area. The score accumulates each time a user records an activity. That provides the basis to determine the user’s areas of interests. The application is going to automatically select users by their score ratings and recommend them to each other. Each time user logs into the application, new buddy requests are generated. The user can then scan through the profiles of the proposed users and decide whether to connect to the user or not. When the users are connected, they become buddies and can leave comments on activities of each other.",

The application runs on Jboss’ application server and EJB container, which holds and retains timer service references Even with the switch to newer technologies, Enterprise Java is still widely used in industry today. The system is aimed at providing a lightweight, straight- forward and user friendly alternative to existing reminder based services, and to demonstrate the application of Java Enterprise Edition principles and implementation. The application is mostly focused towards ease of use, making use of the ‘use it, forget it’ mentality that is essential to any reminder service. After registration, each user is presented with their own individual list of contacts and reminders. Reminders are fully customisable and contain settings to vary the reminder’s usability, such as single use and repeat reminders. Each reminder also contains references to contacts contained in that user’s contact list, to enable the creation of group based, multi-contact reminders. Upon the creation of a reminder, a timer is created on the application server, its timeout settings determined by the times entered by the user as part of reminder creation. Once the reminder expires, a backend processor is used to parse, compile and send email reminders to each contact included.",

Outdoor tracking can be done with GPS and has a very high accuracy rate. The same cannot be said for an indoor tracking system. Android devices in particular are very popular on the market today and provide an API for dealing with Bluetooth connections. Low cost Bluetooth dongles can be placed in fixed locations around a building for mobile devices to search for. Using signal strengths and machine learning, we can calculate the location of the device within the building. This approach provides a versatile system that can be trained to work within any building. It also allows for different levels of accuracy to be achieved depending upon the needs of the user. This project aims to demonstrate the functionality that simple Bluetooth devices can serve and to provide a basis for a cost effective way of increasing security or recording a persons movements.

It can also be used as a developer aid supplying them with feedback about the state of a branch, warning them about a potentially ‘buggy’ area of code where more care would need to be taken when adding or changing the code. Overall this could allow the bug fix process to be a proactive step rather than a reactive one. Bug Prediction Model is written in Java supported by XML.

GPS location awareness has recently gained an advantage within mobile applications as users are willing to have their location monitored for social media purposes. Because of this, we believe our application will be successful as GPS location services allow us to display proximity based advertising. Following an extensive market research, we identified potential to exploit an area of the SmartPhone market which will benefit both retailers and customers. However, users of the application will not be forced to enable GPS to effectively use the application, but they will also have the ability to search for a specific deal genre regardless of location.
